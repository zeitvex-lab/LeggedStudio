# Import Wizard CLI

UFO includes a lightweight import wizard layer for bringing new MuJoCo robot XML files and robot-state CSV/NPZ motion data into the existing robot-aware motion data pipeline.

The available commands are:

- `humanoidverse.tools.robot_inspect`
- `humanoidverse.tools.data_inspect`
- `humanoidverse.tools.data_build`

These tools generate and check configuration files, then call the existing `RobotSpec`, motion adapters, and manifest auto-build path. They do not change FB/TeCH algorithms, MotionLib sampling, or the training environment.

## Supported Public Motion Formats

UFO's public data manifests intentionally expose only three motion formats:

UFO's recommended import path is based on a RobotState schema: `root_pos`, `root_quat`, `dof_pos`, and `fps` or `time`. CSV and NPZ are currently supported file readers for this schema.

- `ufo_pkl`: already processed UFO motion dictionaries, usually produced by UFO tools or existing retargeting pipelines.
- `robot_state_csv`: robot-state CSV files containing root pose and joint positions, interpreted with a robot YAML config.
- `robot_state_npz`: robot-state NPZ files containing root pose and joint positions, interpreted with a robot YAML config.

For new datasets, prefer `robot_state_csv` or `robot_state_npz` with the import wizard. For data that has already been converted into UFO's internal motion dictionary schema, use `ufo_pkl`.

## Recommended Flow

### XML-derived Training Drafts

`robot_inspect` can generate XML-derived draft robot configs for the training
path. Passing `--hydra-out` writes both the UFO RobotTrainingSpec YAML and a
Hydra robot config draft:

```bash
uv run python -m humanoidverse.tools.robot_inspect \
  --xml /path/to/robot.xml \
  --name my_robot \
  --out configs/robots/my_robot.yaml \
  --hydra-out humanoidverse/config/robot/my_robot/my_robot_auto.yaml
```

The draft extracts structural fields from XML, including body names, actuated
joint order, action dimensions, joint ranges, and the freejoint base body.
Training-specific fields still require review: semantic body groups, contact
bodies, default pose, PD gains, actuator parameters, and reward/termination
fields. Generated configs are marked `metadata.review_status: draft`. Formal
experiments should use curated robot configs.

Optional URDF assistance can be enabled with `--urdf /path/to/robot.urdf`. XML
still controls the MuJoCo layout: qpos/qvel order, actuator order, action
dimension, control joint names, and body names are not taken from URDF. URDF is
used only to fill draft hardware hints such as effort, velocity, physical
damping/friction, semantic name hints, and a metadata-only symmetric DOF pair
draft. If XML and URDF joint limits conflict, XML wins by default and the tool
emits a warning. Use `--urdf-joint-name-map` when XML and URDF joint names do not
match exactly.

1. Generate a draft robot config from a MuJoCo XML:

```bash
uv run python -m humanoidverse.tools.robot_inspect \
  --xml /path/to/robot.xml \
  --name my_robot \
  --out configs/robots/my_robot.yaml
```

2. Inspect robot-state CSV/NPZ motion data:

```bash
uv run python -m humanoidverse.tools.data_inspect \
  --robot configs/robots/my_robot.yaml \
  --source /path/to/motions/*.csv \
  --format robot_state_csv \
  --fps 50
```

3. Generate a data manifest and build the full pkl plus near10s training pkl:

```bash
uv run python -m humanoidverse.tools.data_build \
  --robot configs/robots/my_robot.yaml \
  --source /path/to/motions/*.csv \
  --format robot_state_csv \
  --name my_motion \
  --fps 50 \
  --clip-seconds 10 \
  --out configs/data/my_motion_auto_build.yaml \
  --rebuild-cache
```

4. Train with the generated manifest:

```bash
./run_train.sh \
  --agent fb \
  --data-manifest configs/data/my_motion_auto_build.yaml \
  --gpu-ids single \
  --smoke
```

Remove `--smoke` and set the desired GPU and training options only after the import path has been checked.

## Important Notes

`robot_inspect` writes a draft robot YAML, not a final curated robot config. The generated semantic fields are heuristic guesses. Users should inspect and edit at least:

- `base_body`
- `feet`
- `hands`
- `key_bodies`

For robots that already have curated configs, such as G1, formal experiments should continue to use reference configs like `configs/robots/g1_29dof.yaml`.

The import wizard currently solves the robot-aware motion data import workflow and can emit XML-derived training drafts. It does not mean the UFO training environment is fully robot-agnostic, and it does not enable cross-robot shared-policy training by itself.
