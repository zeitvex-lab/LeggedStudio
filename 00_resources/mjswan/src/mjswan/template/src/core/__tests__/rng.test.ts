// seed, so startup DR and every resample schedule reproduce. *Bit-for-bit* replay does
// not, and is not pursued — it is not satisfiable alongside the non-blocking async
// boundary, since every traced term draws from one shared stream and each skips its run
// while a previous one is in flight. Whether a frame skips is wall-clock, so
// machine-dependent. Pinned here so the limitation stays visible.
