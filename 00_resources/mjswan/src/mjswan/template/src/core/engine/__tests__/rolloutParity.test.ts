/**
 * Rollout parity: the whole browser MDP chain against mjlab, over N steps — the only
 * test that runs the pieces composed. Fixture state → real `SlotReader` → real ORT
 * session over the Builder's graph bytes → real `FusedObservation` → group vector, and
 * the same through `TerminationManager` to a verdict.
 *
 * Catches what nothing narrower does: a layout offset, a slot fed under a name the graph
 * does not declare, a lane read from the wrong column, `time_out` counted as a
 * termination.
 *
 * **States are replayed, not co-simulated** — mjlab integrates with `mujoco_warp` and the
 * browser with MuJoCo's WASM, so a free-running comparison would measure MuJoCo against
 * itself. The fixture carries mjlab's state per step plus its own vector and verdicts at
 * that state.
 *
 * Regenerate: `MUJOCO_GL=disable .venv/bin/python tests/dump_rollout_fixture.py`
