"""The ``.swn`` simulation document: a build's data as one file (ADR 0006 §8).

A build is a directory, ``manifest.json`` over ``<project-id>/<scene-id>/``, and that
directory is the document. Packaging it is a ZIP whose entries are the tree's paths, so
unpacking one gives back exactly what a build wrote and nothing is described twice.

In go the manifest and every file under a project directory. The engine
(``index.html``, ``assets/*.js``, WASM) and the author's custom-term module do not: an
app is the engine plus the expanded tree, and mjswan Cloud supplies its own engine.
