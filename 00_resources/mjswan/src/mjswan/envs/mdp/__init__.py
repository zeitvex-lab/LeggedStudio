"""MDP components for mjswan.

``actions`` mirrors ``mjlab.envs.mdp.actions``: Action stays a closed,
permanently-native set (ADR 0005 §7), so ``mjswan.envs.mdp.actions`` carries
real, directly-usable action-term configs, same import pattern as mjlab::

    from mjswan.envs.mdp.actions import JointPositionActionCfg

``observations`` / ``terminations`` / ``events`` are different: mjswan reimplements
none of mjlab's term functions. Pass mjlab's own straight to
``ObservationTermCfg(func=obs_fns.base_lin_vel)`` and the build traces them. These
submodules carry only the ``*Binding`` escape hatch and its ``register_*`` registry.

``commands`` is the exception: a command is a class, and some of mjlab's use constructs
the tracer cannot follow, so it carries trace-friendly rewrites of those bodies.
