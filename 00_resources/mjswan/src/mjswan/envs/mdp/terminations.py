mjswan reimplements none of mjlab's termination functions: a task's real function
object is traced to ONNX at build time, and one reading no time-varying state (like
``time_out``) is classified native automatically. This module carries only the
``TerminationBinding`` escape hatch, for a term that cannot be traced at all.
