        """Add an ONNX policy to this scene.

        The policy runs against an MDP: observations, actions, terminations, commands
        and events (ADR 0006 §3). Pass one as ``mdp`` to share it between policies (the
        checkpoints of one run), or pass the five term sets directly and an anonymous
        :class:`~mjswan.mdp.MdpConfig` is built from them; not both.

        Each term set defaults to the matching field of an mjlab env config, when one
        is available: the ``env_cfg`` passed here, else the one the scene was built
        from by :meth:`ProjectHandle.add_scene_mjlab`. Events default to the scene's own.
        Pass a term set to override that field; pass ``{}`` to say the policy genuinely
        has none. A plain :meth:`ProjectHandle.add_scene` scene has no config to fall
        back on, so there each field means exactly what it says.

        Args:
            policy: ONNX model containing the policy.
            name: Name for the policy (displayed in the UI).
            metadata: Optional metadata dictionary for the policy.
            source_path: Optional source path for the policy ONNX file.
            config_path: Optional source path for the policy config JSON file.
            env_cfg: mjlab env config to take this policy's unset term sets from,
                instead of the scene's — for one scene hosting policies trained against
                different configs. Its control rate must match the scene's
                ``control_dt``, which the scene owns.
            task_id: mjlab task id whose *runner* config supplies the actor's
                observation group and ``clip_actions``. Defaults to the scene's task.
            mdp: The MDP to run against, shared by every policy handed the same object.
                Its unset fields are filled and its mjlab types adapted, in place, by
                the first policy to use it.
            observations: A single observation group, mjlab's whole
                ``env_cfg.observations`` dict, or a dict keyed by the slot names
                ``in_keys`` uses. Prefer the first two: a lone group lands under
                ``"actor"``, the default slot, and needs no ``in_keys`` at all. A group
                named for a training-only network (``"critic"``) is dropped.
            commands: Command term configurations. Custom mjlab terms are converted
                through the Python command-term registry.
            actions: Action term configurations.
            terminations: Termination term configurations.
            events: Event term configurations, in any of the four modes.
            in_keys: The network's input slot table: ``in_keys[i]`` names what fills its
                *i*-th input, an observation group or a tensor the runtime synthesizes
                (``is_init``, ``adapt_hx``, ``time_step``). The mapping is positional, so
                the network's own input names never matter. Required when the network has
                more than one input; a single-input one takes its one observation group.
            out_keys: The output slot table, ``out_keys[i]`` naming the *i*-th output.
                ``action`` is the one the runtime drives the actuators from; a recurrent
                policy also carries ``["next", "adapt_hx"]``. Defaults to ``["action"]``.
            policy_num_actions: Output width for policies whose action count cannot be
                inferred from ``policy_joint_names`` (e.g. muscle-driven ones).
            clip_actions: Symmetric bound on the raw policy output, before any action
                term sees it, mirroring rsl-rl's ``RslRlVecEnvWrapper``. Distinct from
                ``ActionTermCfg.clip``, which bounds ``raw * scale + offset``. Defaults
                to the task's runner config; ``0.0`` is a real bound, not "unset".
            initial_qpos: Initial qpos serialized into the policy config JSON.
            initial_qvel: Initial qvel serialized into the policy config JSON.
            extras: Extra JSON payload merged into the policy config.

        Returns:
            PolicyHandle for configuring the policy (adding commands, etc.)

        ``config_path``, ``observations``, ``commands``, ``actions``, and

        and each defaults to the scene's mjlab env config exactly as in
        :meth:`add_policy` — so for a scene from
        :meth:`ProjectHandle.add_scene_mjlab` the run path alone is enough.

        Args:
            run_path: W&B run path in the format ``"entity/project/run_id"``, or
                a list of such paths to fetch policies from multiple runs.
            only_latest: If ``False`` (default), fetches all ``model_*.pt``
                checkpoints and converts each to ONNX via mjlab — requires
                ``mjlab`` and ``torch`` to be installed and ``task_id`` to be
                provided.  If ``True``, fetches only the ``.onnx`` file from
                each run (the latest exported checkpoint).
            task_id: mjlab task identifier (e.g. ``"go2_flat"``). Defaults to the
                scene's task when it came from :meth:`ProjectHandle.add_scene_mjlab`,
                so it only has to be given for a plain scene. Required when
                ``only_latest=False``; when ``only_latest=True`` it is still used, if
                known, to read the task's runner config.
            config_path: Optional path to a policy config JSON file applied to
                all fetched policies.
            metadata: Optional metadata dictionary applied to all fetched
                policies.
            env_cfg: mjlab env config the unset term sets below are taken from,
                instead of the scene's. See :meth:`add_policy`.
            observations: Observation groups applied to all fetched policies —
                a single group (``env_cfg.observations["actor"]``) or a dict of
                them; see :meth:`add_policy`.
            commands: Command term configurations applied to all fetched policies.

            terminations: Termination term configurations applied to all fetched
                policies.
            clip_actions: Overrides the raw-action bound that would otherwise be
                read from the task's mjlab runner config. Only the
                ``only_latest=True`` path needs it explicitly — that path skips

        Returns:
            Flat list of :class:`PolicyHandle` instances across all runs, in the order
            the runs were provided — **empty when ``only_latest=False``**, since that
            path defers its ``.pt`` conversion to ``Builder.build`` and the checkpoint
            names are not known until then.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If ``only_latest=False`` and ``task_id`` is not provided,
                or if no matching files are found in a W&B run.

        Provide either ``source`` (recommended) or ``url`` — not both.

        is served locally, giving you a fully self-contained deployment with no
        external dependencies. This is the recommended approach.

        Using ``url`` keeps the .spz file on an external server. The app stays

            url: URL to an external .spz splat file. The browser fetches it at
                runtime; the file is not bundled.
            scale: Metric scale factor. Use ``metric_scale_factor`` from your
                capture metadata if available.
            x_offset: X-axis position offset (in scaled splat units).

                your capture metadata if available.
            roll: Roll rotation in degrees applied on top of the COLMAP→Three.js
                base rotation.
            pitch: Pitch rotation in degrees applied on top of the COLMAP→Three.js
