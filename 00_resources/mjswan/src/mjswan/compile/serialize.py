"""Serialize a traced command into its ``policy.json`` entry and ``.onnx`` graph.

One generic ``OnnxCommand`` runtime handler interprets every command from this data,
so the entry has to declare everything it needs to allocate state, supply ``rand``,
thread dynamic reads, and apply any ``entity_write``. The shape is defined by
:func:`command_config` below and consumed by ``core/command/OnnxCommand.ts``; both
sides are covered by tests, so there is no third restatement of it here.
