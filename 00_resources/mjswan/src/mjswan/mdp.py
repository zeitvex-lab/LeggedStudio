"""The MDP a policy runs against, as one unit.

mjlab keeps observations, actions, terminations, commands and events side by side on
``ManagerBasedRlEnvCfg`` and trains a checkpoint against all five at once, so
:class:`MdpConfig` holds them together (ADR 0006 §3).

Identity is by object: two policies handed the *same* config share one MDP, meaning one
``mdp/<id>/`` directory and one set of traced graphs, while two equal but separate
configs are two MDPs. The per-manager keyword arguments on
:meth:`~mjswan.scene.SceneHandle.add_policy` construct an anonymous one.
