"""Adapter for converting mjlab types to mjswan internal representations.

mjlab is a **soft dependency** — this module never fails at import time.
When mjlab is not installed the ``adapt_*`` functions simply return their
inputs unchanged (they are assumed to already be mjswan types).

The adapter detects mjlab types by the module path of any class in the MRO
rather than ``isinstance``, so mjlab does not need to be importable for
mjswan to function.

Mapping strategy
----------------
* **Observation / termination / event functions**: mjlab's own function object is
  traced against the scene's live env at build time. An author can override what gets
  traced via ``register_observation`` / ``register_termination`` / ``register_event``.
* **Commands**: ``type(cfg).__name__`` is looked up in the command registry, which
  either traces the built term or maps it to a permanently-native TS class.
* **Action configs**: ``type(cfg).__name__`` is looked up on
  ``mjswan.envs.mdp.actions`` and dataclass fields are copied. Actions stay a fixed,
  native, non-traced set.
