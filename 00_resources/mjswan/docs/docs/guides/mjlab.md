# Using mjlab

[mjlab](https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab){:target="_blank"} is a GPU-accelerated
reinforcement learning framework built on MuJoCo Warp. mjswan can visualize mjlab tasks
directly — there is no need to export or convert anything.

An mjlab scene is not just a model: it carries the task's viewer, events, terrain, control
rate, and — for any policy attached to it — the whole MDP layer. It also supplies the live
environment that [ONNX tracing](how-it-works.md) needs, so everything on this page works
without a single `set_trace_env` or `control_dt` of your own.

!!! info "Install"
    mjlab is a soft dependency: `pip install 'mjswan[examples]'`. It is needed at **build
    time** only, and nothing about it ships to the browser.

This page walks through three integration levels, from the one-line shortcut to the full manual form.

## 1. One-liner: `Builder.from_mjlab`

The fastest path. `Builder.from_mjlab(task_id, run_path=...)` creates a project, adds the mjlab scene, and (optionally) attaches every `model_*.pt` checkpoint from one or more W&B runs as ONNX policies.

```python
import mjswan

# Just visualize the scene
app = mjswan.Builder.from_mjlab("go2_flat").build()
app.launch()

# Visualize the scene + every checkpoint from a W&B run
app = mjswan.Builder.from_mjlab(
    "Mjlab-Velocity-Flat-Anymal-C",
    run_path="<entity>/<project>/<run_id>",
).build()
app.launch()
```

The W&B form requires both `mjlab` and `torch` (the `model_*.pt` → ONNX conversion runs locally).

Each attached policy configures itself from the task: its observations, commands, actions and terminations all come from the task's `env_cfg`, and its raw-action bound from the task's runner config. For finer control, drop down to the next two patterns.

## 2. Scene helper: `ProjectHandle.add_scene_mjlab`

When you need multiple scenes (one per task) or want to mix mjlab tasks with hand-written scenes, use `add_scene_mjlab(task_id)` on a `ProjectHandle`. It loads the task's MuJoCo spec, applies the task's `viewer` / `events` / terrain data (spawning the single env on a random flat patch when the terrain has one), and returns a normal `SceneHandle`.

mjlab registers two configs per task — `env_cfg` (training) and `play_env_cfg` — and `play` selects between them, as its own `load_env_cfg` does. mjswan defaults to **play**, the opposite of mjlab, because that default serves training scripts and this is a playback tool: the training config sets `episode_length_s` to 10–20 s, which mjswan turns into the browser's `time_out` termination, so a viewer built from it resets the robot every few seconds. Pass `play=False` if you want training-time conditions.

```python
import mjswan
from mjlab.tasks.registry import list_tasks

builder = mjswan.Builder()
project = builder.add_project(name="mjlab Tasks")

for task_id in list_tasks():
    project.add_scene_mjlab(task_id)

builder.build().launch()
```

### Attaching trained policies from W&B

Use `scene.add_policy_wandb(run_path)` to fetch checkpoints from one or more W&B runs and attach them all to the scene:

```python
import mjswan

builder = mjswan.Builder()
project = builder.add_project(name="ANYmal C")

scene = project.add_scene_mjlab("Mjlab-Velocity-Flat-Anymal-C")
scene.add_policy_wandb("<entity>/<project>/<run_id>")

builder.build().launch()
```

The scene keeps the `env_cfg` it was built from, and every policy added to it defaults its observations, commands, actions and terminations to that config — so the run path is all you need. `task_id` also defaults to the scene's task.

### Tracking tasks

mjlab registers its tracking tasks with `commands["motion"].motion_file = ""` for the caller to fill in, but you do not have to: `add_policy_wandb` fetches the run's clip, the builder writes it into the bundle, and the tracing env — constructed at build time, not when the scene is added — reads it from there. So a tracking task is the same two lines as any other:

```python
scene = project.add_scene_mjlab("Mjlab-Tracking-Flat-Unitree-G1")
scene.add_policy_wandb("<entity>/<project>/<run_id>")
```

A `motion_file` you set yourself is left alone, as long as it points at a file that exists.

Each distinct clip is written once per scene and shared by every policy that uses it, so the checkpoints of one run do not each get a copy. The filename is the motion's `name`; two clips with the same name but different content get a `_1` / `_2` suffix.

### Editing the config first

To change anything else about the task, load the config, edit it, and pass it to `add_scene_mjlab` — the policies then inherit your edited version, because the scene holds the same object:

```python
from mjlab.tasks.registry import load_env_cfg

task_id = "Mjlab-Tracking-Flat-Unitree-G1"
# `play=True` here, not on `add_scene_mjlab`: `env_cfg` *is* one of the two configs, so
# there is nothing left for `play` to select — passing both raises.
env_cfg = load_env_cfg(task_id, play=True)
env_cfg.terminations.pop("bad_anchor_ori")

scene = project.add_scene_mjlab(task_id, env_cfg=env_cfg)
scene.add_policy_wandb("<entity>/<project>/<run_id>")
```

Load it **once**. `load_env_cfg` returns a deepcopy, so a second call gives you an equal but separate config, and edits to one are invisible to the other.

### Overriding one field

Pass any of the four to replace just that one; the rest still come from the config. Pass `{}` to say the policy genuinely has none:

```python
scene.add_policy_wandb(
    "<entity>/<project>/<run_id>",
    terminations={"time_out": TerminationTermCfg(func=term_fns.time_out)},
)
```

mjswan adapts mjlab config classes automatically. `observations` also accepts the task's whole `env_cfg.observations` dict or a single group — see [MDP Terms](policy-config.md), which explains why the key matters.

`add_policy_wandb` accepts a `list[str]` for the run path if you want to bundle checkpoints from multiple runs together. The latest checkpoint (highest training step) is marked as the default.

If you only want the exported `.onnx` artifact (skipping the `.pt → .onnx` conversion), pass `only_latest=True` — `task_id` is then optional.

## 3. Full manual form

For a model-only viewer of an mjlab task — no policy, no MDP layer — you can go through
mjlab's own `Scene` and hand the `MjSpec` to plain `add_scene`:

```python
import mjswan
from mjlab.scene import Scene
from mjlab.tasks.registry import load_env_cfg

builder = mjswan.Builder()
project = builder.add_project(name="mjlab Examples")

# `play=True` for the same reason `add_scene_mjlab` defaults to it: this is a viewer.
env_cfg = load_env_cfg("Mjlab-Velocity-Flat-Anymal-C", play=True)
env_cfg.scene.num_envs = 1  # single environment for the viewer
scene_obj = Scene(env_cfg.scene, device="cpu")

project.add_scene(
    spec=scene_obj.spec,  # MjSpec from mjlab
    name="ANYmal C",
)

builder.build().launch()
```

!!! warning "This drops everything except the model"
    A scene built this way has no task attached, so it gets no viewer config, no events, no
    terrain spawning, no `control_dt`, and no tracing environment — and its policies inherit
    no term-set defaults. To customise a task *and* keep all of that, edit the config and
    pass it to `add_scene_mjlab(task_id, env_cfg=...)` as shown
    [above](#editing-the-config-first). Reach for this form only when you genuinely want
    just the geometry.

## What an mjlab scene carries over

| From the task | How it is used |
|---|---|
| `env_cfg.scene` | the MuJoCo spec, compiled and bundled as `scene.mjz` |
| `env_cfg.observations` / `actions` / `commands` / `terminations` | defaults for every policy on the scene, [traced to ONNX](how-it-works.md) |
| `env_cfg.events` | the scene's default events, which every policy that declares none inherits into its MDP; `reset_root_state_uniform` is swapped for a spawn on a random flat terrain patch, since the browser runs one env where mjlab trains many spread across the terrain |
| `env_cfg.sim.timestep × decimation` | `control_dt` |
| `env_cfg.viewer` | the initial camera |
| terrain flat-patch table | baked spawn points |
| the task's **runner** config | which observation group the actor reads, and `clip_actions` |
| the live env | the tracing target for every term body |

Rewards, curricula, metrics and recorders are training-only and simply ignored — mjswan is
a playback tool, so they never reach the bundle.
