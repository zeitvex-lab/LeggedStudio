"""Action clipping: the wire fields, and the mjlab semantics the browser copies.

Two *different* bounds live here, and confusing them is the whole risk:

- ``ActionTermCfg.clip`` — per-target, on the action term, applied to
  ``raw * scale + offset``.
- ``clip_actions`` — symmetric, on the *runner* config, applied to the policy's raw
  output before any term sees it. rsl-rl's ``RslRlVecEnvWrapper.step`` clamps ahead of
  ``env.step``, so mjlab's action manager records the clamped vector and a
  ``last_action`` observation reads the clamped vector.

`ActionTermCfg.clip` was declared on the config and then dropped — `to_dict()` did
not emit it and the runtime had nowhere to apply it — so a task that set bounds got
none. `clip_actions` was read from the runner config, handed to the export-time
wrapper, and never written to the bundle, so it got none either. Both invisible,
because the reference tasks leave both `None`.

Two things are checked here, and the second is the one that matters. Emitting the
field is easy to get right. *Where* the clamp goes is not: mjlab clamps
``raw * scale + offset`` inside ``BaseAction.process_actions`` and only then does
each kind's ``apply_actions`` run, which for ``joint_position`` subtracts the
encoder bias. So the final ``ctrl`` sits outside the declared bound by exactly that
bias — and an implementation that clamped the *target* instead would look perfectly
plausible while being wrong by the bias on every joint.

That is a contract with a dependency rather than with our own code, so it is pinned
against the live mjlab term: if upstream moves the clamp, this fails and says so.
