"""What must *not* be in a built bundle (ADR 0005 acceptance criteria 4 and 5).

Both hold by construction today, and construction is exactly what changes.

* **No training-only managers.** Reward, curriculum, metrics and recorders have no
  browser-side runtime. mjswan never reads them, and a build that *rejected* them
  could build nothing (every mjlab task carries rewards), so what is checkable is
  that the emitted artifacts mention none of them.
* **No term source as executable text.** ONNX ships term bodies as graph bytes, so no
  Python body may travel alongside — not as a source string, not as an eval-able payload.

Both walk the real emitted output rather than inspecting the code that writes it,
so a future serializer that starts attaching a `rewards` block or a `source` string
fails here regardless of how it got there.
