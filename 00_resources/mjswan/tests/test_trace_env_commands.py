"""Tracing a term that reads a command the browser owns.

Layer: L2 (real tracer, hand-built env — no mjlab env needed).

Some commands have no Python side to trace against: a `UiCommand` is a slider, and
a native `TrackingCommand` is a clip lookup (data, not math). A term that does
arithmetic on one is still an ordinary traced body, and its reads have to become
graph *inputs* the runtime serves from `getStateField`. `TraceCommandManager` is
what lets the discovery pass see them at all; without it the read raises and the
term looks untraceable.

What must hold: each read lands as a `{command, field}` slot with the shape the
stand-in had (a look-ahead window is rank 3, and the runtime needs the rank to feed
its flat value array), and nothing gets baked — a frozen command value is a policy
that ignores its own controls.
