"""Command-term parity: traced graph vs the live mjlab term (ADR 0005 §3).

Layer: L3 (needs the ``examples`` extras and a warp CPU-kernel compile, so
``slow``/``mjlab``).

Commands are the most randomness-heavy layer in the system — `lift_height` draws 7
values per resample, the tracking RSI graph 41 — so every one runs through the RNG
spy/replay harness.

The resolution follows the Builder's own path: the registry's `CommandBinding`
supplies `state_fields`, `command_field` and any `trace_override`, and
`cfg.build(env)` constructs the term. So a registration that drifts from its term
fails here rather than shipping.
