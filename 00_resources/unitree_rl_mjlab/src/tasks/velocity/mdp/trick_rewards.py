  A two-wheel command has a simple physical endpoint: its opposite pair of
  wheel centres must be clear of the plane.  Contact bits alone provide no
  useful gradient until a tyre has already separated, which permits a low
  folded four-wheel crouch to persist even when a gravity-direction reward is
  improving.  This measures only the average height of the non-support wheels
  and is zero at their ordinary ground-level reset.  It neither selects joint
  angles nor prescribes the route by which the robot raises them.
