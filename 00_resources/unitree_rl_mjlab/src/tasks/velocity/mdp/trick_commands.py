"""Compact commands for the Go2W trick environments.

The actor only receives the returned tensors.  Task-specific targets such as
support contacts, gravity directions, and aerial rotation axes remain inside
the reward functions so that the policy interface stays proprioceptive.

The aerial command is an *event*, not a persistent velocity request: a
non-zero one-hot is held for one attempt and is cleared after its first
landing decision window, whether that landing succeeds or fails.  A failed
partial hop therefore cannot retry the maneuver or keep the one-hot alive to
farm recovery reward.

  The public layout is ``[normal, front, rear, left, right, spin_rate]``.

  ``normal`` with zero rate is ordinary four-wheel idle; with a nonzero rate
  it requests the compact, level four-wheel common-axle pivot.  Its sign
  controls only world-down rotation direction.  Front/rear two-wheel modes
  retain that signed rotation request; left/right are static side supports and
  explicitly ignore it.  The stance itself—and the leg reshaping needed to
  make a local pivot possible—is
  discovered by the policy rather than encoded in the command.
