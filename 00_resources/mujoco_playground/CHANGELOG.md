# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-16

- Added vision-based PPO training configs for `CartpoleBalance` and
  `PandaPickCubeCartesian` with tuned hyperparameters.
- Update vision notebooks to use MuJoCo Warp.
- Default MuJoCo implementation for all envs is now MuJoCo Warp.
- Renamed deprecated `nconmax` / `nccdmax` config fields to `naconmax` /
  `naccdmax` across all environments, matching the updated MJX API.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-07

- Pass through the [MuJoCo Warp](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp)
  (MjWarp) implementation to MJX, so that MuJoCo Playground environments can
  train with MuJoCo Warp! You can pass through the implementation via the config
  override
  `registry.load('CartpoleBalance', config_overrides={'impl': 'warp'})`.
- Update environments to utilize contact sensors and remove `collision.py`.
- Remove `mjx_env.init` in favor of `mjx_env.make_data` since `make_data`
  now requires an `MjModel` argument rather than an `mjx.Model` argument.
- Add device to `mjx_env.make_data`, fixes #174.
- Update AutoResetWrapper to allow full resets on done. Fixes #179. Also
  provides a means for doing curriculum learning via
  `state.info['AutoResetWrapper_done_count']`, see #140.
- Update dependencies to use `mujoco>=3.4` and `warp-lang>=1.11`.

## [0.0.5] - 2025-06-23

- Change `light_directional` to `light_type` following MuJoCo API change from version 3.3.2 to 3.3.3. Fixes https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_playground/issues/142.
- Fix bug in `get_qpos_ids`.
- Implement `render` in Wrapper.
