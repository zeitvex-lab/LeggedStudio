"""Texture-based (tex3d) sparse SDF construction and sampling.

This module provides a GPU-accelerated sparse SDF implementation using 3D CUDA textures.
Construction mirrors the NanoVDB sparse-volume pattern in ``sdf_utils.py``:

1. Check subgrid occupancy by querying the source SDF at subgrid centers
2. Build the background/coarse SDF by querying the source at subgrid corner positions
3. Populate only occupied subgrid textures by querying the source at each texel

The format uses:
- A coarse 3D texture for background/far-field sampling
- A packed subgrid 3D texture for narrow-band high-resolution sampling
- An indirection array mapping coarse cells to subgrid blocks

Sampling uses analytical trilinear gradient computation from 8 corner texel reads,
providing exact accuracy with only 8 texture reads (vs 56 for finite differences).

# SDF texture-sampling paths
# ============================================================================
#
# Two pairs of trilinear samplers are provided -- pick at the call site:
#
# * :func:`texture_sample_sdf` / :func:`texture_sample_sdf_grad` --
#   ``"software"`` path. Four point-sampled reads, each returning adjacent
#   X samples, followed by a float32 trilinear blend. Most accurate; avoids
#   the 8-bit fixed-point interpolation weights the texture unit's hardware
#   filter uses. Default for hydroelastic contact, where contact-force
#   precision feeds back into the stress integration over the volume.
#
# * :func:`texture_sample_sdf_hw` / :func:`texture_sample_sdf_grad_hw` --
#   ``"hardware"`` path. One ``wp.texture_sample`` for the value, six
#   centred-difference samples for the gradient. Far fewer texture fetches
#   per query in principle; routes everything through the GPU's filter unit
#   (8-bit fixed-point interpolation weights). Used by the mesh-SDF
#   narrow phase, where the small extra jitter is absorbed by PGS.
#
# Paired storage uses two-channel, ``LINEAR``-filtered textures: channel zero
# stores the sample at X and channel one its +X neighbor. Scalar storage uses
# one channel per texel. Sampling at ``int + 0.5`` resolves to the exact texel
# value in either layout; the selected sampler controls how adjacent X values
# are fetched.

        margin: extra AABB padding [m].
        narrow_band_range: signed narrow-band distance range [m] as ``(inner, outer)``.
        max_resolution: maximum grid dimension [voxel]. Used when
            ``target_voxel_size`` is not provided. Defaults to 64 when both
            ``max_resolution`` and ``target_voxel_size`` are ``None``.
        target_voxel_size: target voxel size [m] along the longest padded-AABB
            axis. When provided, takes precedence over ``max_resolution`` and
            ``max_resolution`` is derived as
            ``ceil(max_padded_extent / target_voxel_size)`` then rounded up to

        subgrid_size: cells per subgrid.
        quantization_mode: :class:`QuantizationMode` value.
        winding_threshold: winding number threshold for inside/outside classification.
        scale_baked: whether shape scale was baked into the mesh vertices.
        sign_mode: inside/outside strategy for the distance queries.
            :data:`SIGN_MODE_WINDING` (default) uses winding numbers;
            :data:`SIGN_MODE_PARITY` uses parity ray-casts (cheaper,
            requires a closed manifold mesh); :data:`SIGN_MODE_NORMAL`
            uses the angle-weighted pseudo-normal (for open meshes).
        paired_samples: Store adjacent X samples together for faster software interpolation.
        device: Warp device string. ``None`` uses the mesh's device.
        return_sparse_data: when ``True``, also return the raw cooked
            ``sparse_data`` dict produced by
            :func:`build_sparse_sdf_from_mesh` (or ``None`` for degenerate
