# ``_SDF_QUERY_RADIUS_SLACK * threshold`` bounds, and these queries only run at
# points the narrow phase already placed near the surface, so the bound is
# never binding. The queries operate in mesh-local coordinates (per-shape scale
# is divided out), so there is no global unit to tie it to; 1e11 is effectively
# unbounded for any asset under any unit convention (~8x Earth's diameter in
# millimeters). Going much larger is unsafe: Warp's mesh queries square
# ``max_dist`` internally, and the no-hit branches return it as a sentinel that
# contact math multiplies by per-shape scale (budgeted up to 1e6 for extreme
# unit conversions): (1e11 * 1e6)^2 = 1e34 clears float32 max (~3.4e38) by

        ``precision_target`` is the unscaled SDF space precision the caller
        cares about. Brent's tolerance floor is set
