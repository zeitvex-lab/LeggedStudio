    Every concrete control law (joint impedance, differential IK, …) subclasses
    :class:`ControllerBase` directly. There is no framework-level composition: users
    who want to combine multiple control laws call each one's :meth:`step`
    in sequence themselves.

    Subclasses are responsible for:

    - :meth:`is_graphable`: predicate the user can query to decide whether
      graph capture is possible.
    - :meth:`input`, :meth:`output`: allocate fresh typed input/output structs.
      Baked-in values (gains passed as a ``wp.array`` or scalar at
      construction) are stored on the controller and do **not** appear on the
      input struct.
    - :meth:`step`: read the input struct's live arrays, run kernels, write
      the output struct's live arrays. Writes are slot-replacing (``=``, not
      ``+=``); composing laws is the user's job.
