@dataclass
class ModelKaminoInfo:
    """A container holding the time-invariant information and metadata of a model.

    Kamino lays out the constraints of each world in the following order::

        | dynamic | kinematic | Coulomb friction | effort limits | position limits | contacts |

    where all constraints except contacts are associated with joints.

    These constraint types form groups:

    - **Bilateral:** dynamic and kinematic constraints. These are equality
      constraints without a projection operator.
    - **Bounded:** Coulomb joint friction and effort limit constraints. They have box
      constraints on the Lagrange multipliers.
    - **Unilateral:** position-limit and contact constraints. Their multipliers
      are projected onto the nonnegative half-line and Coulomb cone, respectively.

    All constraints that have a projection operator, i.e. bounded and
    unilateral, are considered **Inequality** constraints.

    The sizes and topologies of the bilateral and bounded groups are fixed when
    the model is constructed. The unilateral group instead reserves capacity for
    position limits and contacts; the active constraints in this group may change
    during the simulation.
