"""Effective inverse-mass response for articulated systems.

:class:`JointSpaceResponse` owns the full inverse joint-space mass block for each
articulation. There are two ways to update it:

- :meth:`JointSpaceResponse.refresh` assembles the mass matrix itself.
- :meth:`JointSpaceResponse.refresh_from_solve` reuses a solver's own inertia
  without materializing it, so factorized solvers work too.

Both use preallocated buffers and device kernels, so they can be captured in a
CUDA graph.
