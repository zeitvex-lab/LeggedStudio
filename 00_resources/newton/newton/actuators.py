"""GPU-accelerated actuator models for physics simulations.

This module provides a modular library of actuator components — drives,
clamping, and delay — that compute joint effort from simulation state and
control targets. Components are composed into an :class:`Actuator` instance
and registered with :meth:`~newton.ModelBuilder.add_actuator` during model
construction.

.. experimental::

    The actuator API may change without prior notice. Feedback is welcome —
    please file issues or discussion threads.
