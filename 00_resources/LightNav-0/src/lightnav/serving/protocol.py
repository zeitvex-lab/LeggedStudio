    """Pointing PIXELS in the frame the client just sent, for either token format.

    The client gets converted pixels, never token ids: the encoding is the server's
    business, and both formats in circulation decode to the same thing.

    * ``posxy`` — ``<apos><pos_x><pos_y>``, two shared axis tokens at 1000 bins each
      (~0.5 px on a 480-wide frame). Checked first: its bare ``<apos>`` marker cannot
      be confused with the grid's ``<apos_K>``, which requires ``_<digits>``.
    * ``grid`` — ``<apos_K>``, one id over a 48x27 cell grid (10 px cells at the
      480x270 label resolution).

    Returns None when the text carries neither, so a tpos-only or legacy checkpoint
    sends nothing rather than a bag of nulls.

    ``*_state`` says WHY a pixel is null, which the pixel cannot: ``point`` (it is not
    null), ``rot_left`` / ``rot_right`` / ``stop`` for an apos directive (grid ids
    1297-1299, posxy ``<rotl>`` / ``<rotr>`` / ``<stop>``), ``not_visible`` for an opos
    that saw nothing (grid id 0, posxy ``<novis>``), or ``none`` when the checkpoint did
    not emit that channel at all. Without it all four collapse into the same null and
    "rotate left", "arrived, stop" and "target not visible" become the same message —
    and only the last of them is recoverable elsewhere (from ``visible``). Note that an
    apos ``stop`` directive does NOT imply the response's top-level ``stop``, which
    reports the decoded action (zero waypoints), not the pointing channel.

    ``frame_size`` travels with the pixels because a pixel without the resolution it
    refers to is not a location: the client may render at a different size than it
    submitted, and the server resizes to yet another one internally.

    ``*_clamped`` marks a boundary cell or edge bin. Both encoders clamp u/v into range
    before quantising, so such a value means "at that edge OR beyond it" and its pixel
    is only the edge cell's centre. This is the one thing a client cannot recover from
    the pixel alone, and drawing a confident marker without it asserts more than the
    model said.
