# Model assets and parameters

Checkpoint layout, the action decoder, `eval_config.json` and every server / CLI parameter.

## Checkpoint

A Hugging Face directory (or a directory containing `hf_ckpt/`) with `config.json`,
`model*.safetensors`, `tokenizer*`, `processor_config.json`, and ideally
`eval_config.json`. The architecture must be stock `Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration`; the
trajectory / action tokens are ordinary rows of the embedding table.

## Action decoder

An **RVQ action-tokenizer bundle**: a directory with `manifest.json`, the per-level
codebook `.npy` files and the `jacobian_weights` file it names. The released checkpoints
ship it as `action_tokenizer/`, referenced from `eval_config.json`, so it is found without
flags; `--action_tokenizer_bundle` overrides it.

## `eval_config.json` (processing parameters)

If present next to or above the checkpoint (the search walks up four parents, so
`hf_ckpt/`, the `global_step_*` directory and the run root are all covered), it supplies the
processing parameters that must match training and cannot be guessed:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "common": {"video_size": [224, 320], "pool_enable": true, "pool_spatial": 2,
             "pool_mode": "avg", "pool_stage": "pre_vit"},
  "tasks": {
    "trackvla": {"num_history_frames": 64, "predict_horizon": 10, "video_fps": 4,
                 "slowfast_tiers": null,
                 "action_tokenizer": {"method": "rvq", "bundle_path": "/path/to/action_tokenizer"}},
    "vlnce":    {"num_history_frames": 64, "predict_horizon": 10, "video_fps": 4,
                 "action_tokenizer": {"method": "rvq", "bundle_path": "action_tokenizer"}}
  }
}
```

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `common.video_size` | model input frame size `[H, W]`; every frame is resized to it |
| `common.pool_*` | spatial pooling of vision tokens (`pool_stage` `pre_vit` or `post_vit`) |
| `tasks.<task>.num_history_frames` | history window (frames) fed to the model per step |
| `tasks.<task>.predict_horizon` | trajectory horizon `H` (rows per chunk) |
| `tasks.<task>.video_fps` | frame rate the checkpoint was trained at (send frames at this rate or faster; waypoint rows carry no time base of their own, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)) |
| `tasks.<task>.slowfast_tiers` | optional multi-rate history layout (SlowFast checkpoints keep the whole episode) |
| `tasks.<task>.action_tokenizer` | decoder snapshot: `{"method": "rvq", "bundle_path"}`; relative paths resolve against the config's directory |

`tasks` is keyed by task: `trackvla` for tracking (`--task tracking`), `vlnce` for
navigation (`--task vln`, and the Habitat evaluation). Values are read automatically; the CLIs'
`--num_history_frames` (and `--pool_spatial`, where offered) override them. Without the file the code
falls back to conservative defaults (`num_history_frames=16`, no pooling,
`video_size=(224, 320)`) which will not match a trained checkpoint — treat a missing
`eval_config.json` as a warning sign. Full schema: `src/lightnav/eval_config.py`.


### Shipping the action decoder with the checkpoint

`tasks.<task>.action_tokenizer.bundle_path` may be a **relative path**; it is resolved
against the directory holding `eval_config.json` (falling back to the checkpoint
directory). The released checkpoints ship their decoder this way:

```
hf_ckpt/
  config.json, model-*.safetensors, tokenizer*, processor_config.json
  eval_config.json          # bundle_path: "action_tokenizer" (both tasks)
  action_tokenizer/         # manifest.json + codebook_l*.npy + jacobian_weights.npy (+ alpha)
```

With such a layout `lightnav-serve`, `lightnav-predict`, `lightnav-eval-habitat` and
`build_tracking_agent()` need no `--action_tokenizer_bundle`: the
decoder is taken from the task entry that matches the server task (`--task tracking` →
`trackvla`, `--task vln` → `vlnce`), then from the other tasks, then from the sibling
directories `action_tokenizer/<task>` or `action_tokenizer/`. The explicit flag always
wins.

## Server / CLI parameters

`lightnav-serve` flags (environment names are what `scripts/start_servers.sh` and
`docker/entrypoint.sh` read):

| Flag | Env | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--model_path` | `MODEL_PATH` | required | checkpoint directory |
| `--action_tokenizer_bundle` | `ACTION_TOKENIZER_BUNDLE` | from the checkpoint | RVQ bundle dir; overrides the decoder the checkpoint ships |
| `--task` | `TASK` | `tracking` | `tracking` (tracking prompt, `tasks.trackvla`) or `vln` (VLN prompt, `tasks.vlnce`) |
| `--backend` | `BACKEND` | `vllm_local` | `vllm_local` or `hf` |
| `--gpu_memory_utilization` | `GPU_MEM_UTIL` | `0.85` | fraction of GPU memory handed to the vLLM engine |
| `--max_batch_size` | `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` | `8` | max sessions per scheduler tick; also sizes vLLM `max_num_seqs`. `1` = strictly serial |
| `--max_wait_ms` | `MAX_WAIT_MS` | `8` | max wait to fill a batch; a lone request is flushed after 2 ms |
| `--quantization` | `VLLM_QUANT` | none (bf16) | `fp8_llm_only`: fp8 LLM, bf16 ViT (~1.5× on Jetson Thor). On SM 11.0 also set `VLLM_DISABLED_KERNELS`; `scripts/serve_thor.sh` does both. See [JETSON_THOR.md](JETSON_THOR.md) |
| `--vit_cache_entries` | `VLN_VIT_CACHE_ENTRIES` | auto (512 w/ SlowFast) | ViT tubelet LRU capacity (`vllm_local`; speed only, never output). Long robot sessions want `1024` |
| `--num_history_frames` | `NUM_HISTORY_FRAMES` | checkpoint config | history-window override (normally leave unset) |
| `--pool_spatial` | `POOL_SPATIAL` | checkpoint config | spatial-pooling override |
| `--aspect_mode` | `ASPECT_MODE` | `stretch` | `stretch`: resize every frame to `video_size` (training behaviour); `keep`: per-session size with the camera's aspect ratio at the same pixel budget (4:3 → 288×384 for a 256×448 checkpoint) |
| `--max_new_tokens` | `MAX_NEW_TOKENS` | `8` | lower bound for the per-step decode cap (see below) |
| `--host` / `--port` | `HOST` / `PORT` | `0.0.0.0` / `8050` | bind address |

| `--no_warmup` | – | off | skip the synthetic warm-up inference before binding the port |
| `--record_dir` | `RECORD_DIR` | off | record every connection's episodes (frames + per-step records) for `lightnav-render` (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)) |
| `--record_fps`, `--record_timeline`, `--no_record_images` | `RECORD_FPS`, `RECORD_TIMELINE`, `RECORD_IMAGES` | `10`, `realtime`, images on | recording defaults written to the manifest / frame storage |
| `--cam_hfov_deg`, `--cam_height`, `--traj_forward_offset`, `--waypoint_dt_s` | `CAM_HFOV_DEG`, `CAM_HEIGHT`, `TRAJ_FORWARD_OFFSET`, `WAYPOINT_DT_S` | `90`, `0.5`, auto, `0.1` | client-camera geometry and HUD convention used only by the rendered overlay |

### MuJoCo demo parameters

`mujoco_demo` is a separate `uv` project. Run `./run.sh` for its bundled
TurtleBot, or use `uv run --extra microduck vln-mujoco ...` when selecting the
optional MicroDuck backend. MicroDuck needs two external files, the MJCF from
`pollen-robotics/microduck_rl` and an ONNX policy from
`pollen-robotics/microduck-policies`; the download steps are in
[mujoco_demo/README.md](../mujoco_demo/README.md#microduck-optional).

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--host` / `--port` | `127.0.0.1` / `8088` | web-console bind address |
| `--vln-server` | empty | default LightNav WebSocket URL shown in the console |
| `--robot` | `turtlebot` | robot backend: `turtlebot` or `microduck` |
| `--robot-model` | none | external MicroDuck MJCF; required only with `--robot microduck` |
| `--walking-policy` | none | external MicroDuck ONNX policy; required only with `--robot microduck` |

Engine-level environment variables (no flag):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VLN_KV_CACHE_GIB` | auto | vLLM KV-cache size in GiB (auto-scales with `max_num_seqs`, floor 2 GiB) |
| `VLN_VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER` | `0` | `1` disables CUDA-graph capture (faster start, slower steps) |
| `LIGHTNAV_ATTN` | `sdpa` | attention implementation for the `hf` backend (e.g. `flash_attention_2`) |
| `VLN_EVAL_TEMPERATURE` / `TOP_P` / `TOP_K` | greedy | sampling knobs for experiments; benchmark numbers assume they are unset |

**Decode token budget.** A step emits a *grounding prefix* followed by the action token(s):
one `<act_l{d}_*>` per RVQ level. The server
probes the tokenizer for the grounding families it knows and caps generation at
`max(--max_new_tokens, prefix + action_tokens)`, which saves the decode step otherwise spent
reaching `eos` without ever truncating the action.

| checkpoint family | grounding prefix | tokens |
|---|---|---|
| tracking, legacy | `<tpos_k>` | 1 |
| tracking + grid pointing | `<opos_k>` | 1 |
| navigation + dual pointing | `<apos_A><opos_O>` | 2 |

**GPU sizing.** The 4B checkpoint needs ~10 GB for weights in bf16 plus the vLLM KV cache;
one 24 GB GPU comfortably serves one engine with `--gpu_memory_utilization 0.85`. When
several servers share a GPU, `scripts/start_servers.sh` divides the utilisation by
`SERVERS_PER_GPU`.

Note what `--gpu_memory_utilization` does *not* do here. The engine passes an explicit
`kv_cache_memory_bytes` (`VLN_KV_CACHE_GIB`, floor 2 GiB) and therefore skips vLLM's
profile run, so real usage is roughly weights + that KV cache + CUDA graphs (~15 GB for
the released 4B checkpoint) whatever the fraction says. The fraction still acts as the
ceiling vLLM checks against free memory at start-up, so lower it when the GPU is shared
with another job, and raise `VLN_KV_CACHE_GIB` — not the fraction — when you want a
bigger KV cache.

## Input aspect ratio (`--aspect_mode`)

The checkpoints are trained on frames resized to a fixed `common.video_size` (256×448 for
the released checkpoint, ≈16:9). By default (`stretch`) every client frame is resized to
that size regardless of its aspect ratio, exactly as in training — a 4:3 camera therefore
arrives horizontally squeezed.

`--aspect_mode keep` (env `ASPECT_MODE=keep`; also `lightnav-predict --aspect_mode`,
`lightnav-eval-habitat --aspect_mode`, `build_tracking_agent(aspect_mode=)`) instead picks,
per session from its first frame, the size with the **source aspect ratio** whose area is
closest to `video_size` and whose sides are multiples of 32 (patch × merge; and of the pre-ViT
pooling factors when the checkpoint pools before the ViT). The vision-token count per frame
stays at the training budget, so history length and sequence length are unchanged:

| camera | `stretch` | `keep` |
|---|---|---|
| 16:9 (480×270, 1920×1080) | 256×448 | 256×448 (identical) |
| 4:3 (640×480) | 256×448 (squeezed) | 288×384 |
| 1:1 | 256×448 | 352×352 |

Frames within one session must share one size (the first frame decides; `reset` starts
over). `keep` avoids geometric distortion but changes the token grid the model sees, which
the released checkpoint was not trained on — validate on your robot before relying on it.
Full native resolution (feeding the camera's own pixel count) is not supported.
