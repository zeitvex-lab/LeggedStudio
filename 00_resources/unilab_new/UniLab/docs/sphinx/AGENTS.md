## Source Structure

```text
source/
├── index.md                 # root redirect → en/0-index.html (no language picker)
├── en/                      # English tree (site root, shown in sidebar nav)
├── zh_CN/                   # Chinese tree (hidden from sidebar, via switcher only)
├── adr/                     # shared ADR, one set
├── api_reference/           # shared autodoc output from src/ docstrings
├── glossary.md
├── changelog.md
├── _static/
└── _templates/
    ├── sidebar/
    │   └── lang_switcher.html   # language dropdown in sidebar
    └── autosummary/
```

`source/en/` is the **default site root**. Visitors land on `/en/0-index.html`
directly (root `index.md` is a redirect). The sidebar navigation tree only
shows the **active language root subtree** — when viewing an English page the
sidebar contains only `en/...` pages; when viewing a Chinese page it contains
only `zh_CN/...`. Shared resources (`adr/`, `api_reference/`, `glossary.md`,
`changelog.md`) **do not appear directly in the sidebar** because they live
outside both language roots.

`source/en/` and `source/zh_CN/` are parallel language roots, but they are
**not currently a strict 1:1 path mirror**. Both roots use numbered section
directories and numbered Markdown files, while some sections exist only in one
language. The language switcher uses an explicit path map in `conf.py`
(`_LANGUAGE_PATH_FORWARD`) to handle the mismatch — **when adding a new English
page, add a corresponding entry to that map** so the switcher lands somewhere
sensible (or omit the entry to fall back to the zh_CN index).

Do not add per-page language button blocks or hand-written cross-language
navigation. The sidebar language switcher handles language changes globally.

### Section indexes and shared resources

Every multi-page section under a language root has a section index page that
introduces the section and contains a hidden toctree of its sibling pages.
Existing unnumbered sections use `index.md` recursively:
`en/3-deployment/0-index.md`, `en/3-deployment/1-sim_to_real/0-index.md`,
`en/4-developer_guide/1-architecture/0-index.md`, `en/2-user_guide/7-tooling/0-index.md`,
etc. Ordered sections may use numbered filenames, such as
`en/1-getting_started/0-index.md`, `1-quick_demo.md`, and `2-installation.md`.
When a section uses numbered filenames, keep the file numbers and toctree order
aligned. Adding a new section means adding its section index page and including
the section in the parent index's toctree.

Shared resources are reached through **language-local wrapper pages**, not by
including the shared docs directly in a language toctree. Example: instead of

```markdown
<!-- BAD: would pull /glossary into the sidebar tree -->
```{toctree}
/glossary
```
```

the English reference section uses

```markdown
<!-- GOOD: links via {doc} without inserting the shared page into the
     sidebar subtree -->
- {doc}`Shared glossary </glossary>`
```

See `en/5-reference/4-adr.md`, `en/5-reference/2-glossary.md`, `en/5-reference/3-changelog.md`
for the established pattern. The wrapper page is what shows up in the
language sidebar; the actual shared content remains accessible via the
language-independent absolute path.

## Core Principles

1. **Evidence only**: only document facts that can be verified in `src/`,
   `src/unilab/conf/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, ADRs, or generated support data.
2. **Code is the source of truth**: names, signatures, defaults, Hydra keys, and
   commands follow the repository, not memory.
3. **Owner layer first**: scripts assemble; contracts live in backend, env,
   registry/config, runner/IPC, or algorithm owner layers.
4. **Link, do not duplicate**: English developer pages should summarize and link
   to ADRs or the development standard instead of copying the full Chinese
   standard.
5. **Config first**: backend/task/reward behavior belongs in Hydra owner YAMLs
   and registries where possible.
6. **API reference is autodoc**: `source/api_reference/` pages should contain
   autodoc/autosummary directives. Improve API prose in `src/unilab/**/*.py`
   docstrings.
7. **Use canonical commands**: user-facing examples use the top-level CLI:
   `uv run train --algo <algo> --task <task> --sim <backend>`,
   `uv run eval ...`, or `uv run demo`. Script paths such as
   `src/unilab/scripts/train_rsl_rl.py` may be named as implementation evidence, but they
   are not the primary command shape for docs readers.

## Before Writing

1. Decide the language root: `source/en/` or `source/zh_CN/`.
2. Locate the topic in `user_guide`, `developer_guide`, `transfer`, or `agents`.
3. Search first with `rg` / `rg --files`; update an existing page instead of
   creating a duplicate.
4. Gather evidence near the claim:
   - algorithms and tasks: `src/unilab/conf/`, `src/unilab/scripts/train_*.py`, `src/unilab/algos/`
   - env contract: `src/unilab/base/np_env.py`, `src/unilab/algos/rsl_rl.py`
   - backend contract: `src/unilab/base/backend/base.py`
   - registry: `src/unilab/base/registry.py`
   - runner/IPC: `src/unilab/ipc/`, `src/unilab/training/run.py`
   - architecture: ADRs and `development-standard.md`
5. Check the other language for a related topic, but do not force path mirroring
   or mass renames.
6. If adding or deleting a page, update the relevant toctree.

## Navigation Rules

- **English pages**: do not hand-write `## Navigation`, `Previous`, or `Next`
  sections. Furo/Sphinx prev-next navigation comes from toctree order. If an
  English page in your edit scope still has a manual navigation block, remove it.
- **Chinese pages**: same rule as English — do not hand-write a `## Navigation`,
  `Previous`, or `Next` block, and do not add a `语言: 简体中文` language line.
  Furo's sidebar + prev/next handles navigation; the sidebar language switcher
  indicates the language. (These manual footers were removed; there is no longer
  a `check_zh_cn_doc_shape` contract.)
- **Root/language switching**: route language changes through the root landing and
  language switcher. Do not add ordinary-page language button pickers.

## Link And Path Rules

| Scenario | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Same-language doc link | MyST `{doc}` relative path, such as `{doc}`algorithms/ppo`` |
| Shared ADR or root-level page | Absolute `{doc}` path, such as `{doc}`/adr/ADR-0003-task-owner-and-config-compose-contract`` |
| Cross-language canonical link | Absolute `{doc}` path, such as `{doc}`/zh_CN/4-developer_guide/0-index`` |
| Source/config/test path in prose | Backticks: `src/unilab/base/np_env.py` |
| GitHub source link | Full GitHub URL to an existing file when a clickable source link is needed |

Avoid old paths such as `docs/users/`, `docs/developers/`, and
`../../README.md` from Sphinx source pages.

## zh_CN Shape

Every `source/zh_CN/**.md` page uses the same minimal shape as its English
mirror — title, then body. Do not add a `语言: 简体中文` language line or a
manual `## Navigation` footer (both removed; Furo handles navigation):

```markdown
# <标题>

<正文>
```

Do not paste English prose into a Chinese placeholder; a short honest Chinese
placeholder is better than a fake translation.

## ADR Rules

ADR files live in `source/adr/` and are shared across languages.

- New ADR names use `ADR-NNNN-kebab-title.md`.
- Use `source/adr/ADR-TEMPLATE.md`.
- Required fields: `- Status:`, `- Date:`, `- Owners:`, `- Supersedes:`,
  `- Superseded by:`, `## Alternatives Considered`, `## Evidence In Repo`,
  `## Related Documents`.
- Link ADRs from developer docs with absolute `{doc}` paths.
- ADR text is currently Chinese-first to avoid governance drift; English pages
  can summarize and link.

## Support Matrix

`source/zh_CN/5-reference/5-support_matrix.md` has a
generated block owned by `scripts/generate_support_matrix.py`.

After task/backend support changes, run:

```bash
uv run scripts/generate_support_matrix.py --write
```

Do not hand-edit the generated block.

## Toctree Rules

- Add pages to the relevant language section's `index.md` toctree (e.g.
  `en/2-user_guide/7-tooling/0-index.md` for a new tooling page). Then add the
  section to its parent index if it is a new section.
- **Do not put shared pages (`/adr/...`, `/api_reference/...`, `/glossary`,
  `/changelog`) into a language toctree.** That would re-insert them into
  the sidebar subtree. Use the wrapper-page pattern in `en/5-reference/`
  (plain `{doc}` link, no toctree).
- English toctrees should only reference English pages (`en/...`).
- Chinese toctrees may keep legacy numbered paths for compatibility.
- Adding a new English page also means adding a `_LANGUAGE_PATH_FORWARD`
  entry in `conf.py` if there is a Chinese equivalent worth pointing the
  switcher to.
- Deleting or renaming a page requires `rg` for all `{doc}` and toctree
  references **and** for `_LANGUAGE_PATH_FORWARD` entries. Avoid renames
  unless the migration is explicitly in scope.

## Concrete Anti-Patterns

- Marketing claims without benchmark evidence.
- "Coming soon", roadmap promises, or unsupported feature claims.
- Backend support claims that are not backed by registry/config/test data.
- `training.sim_backend=...` as a standalone backend switch. Use the
  argparse-style flags on the top-level CLI:
  `uv run train --algo <algo> --task <task> --sim <backend>`
  (and the matching `uv run eval` / `uv run demo` forms). Do not teach
  `task=<task>/<backend>` Hydra overrides as user-facing CLI examples.
- Env hot paths that parse assets/XML or probe backend private methods.
- Hand-written API signatures in `source/api_reference/`.
- Manual `## Navigation` / `Previous` / `Next` blocks or `语言: 简体中文` lines on any page (en or zh).

## Validation

For docs-only changes, run:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/scripts/test_check_docs.py -q
cd docs/sphinx
UNILAB_DOCS_SKIP_AUTODOC=1 uv run --no-project --with-requirements requirements.txt sphinx-build -b html -n source build/html
```

If you changed generated support data, run the generator first. If you changed
`src/unilab/**/*.py` or training behavior, follow the top-level repo validation
rules instead of treating the change as docs-only.

Before reporting success, confirm:

- all cited `src/`, `src/unilab/conf/`, `tests/`, and `scripts/` paths exist;
- English pages in scope have no manual navigation block;
- root, `en/0-index.md`, and `zh_CN/0-index.md` remain included in toctrees;
- any warnings from Sphinx are understood and not introduced by the current edit.
