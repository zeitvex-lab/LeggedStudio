# API Reference

Detailed reference for the `unilab` Python package. Every public class,
function, and submodule is auto-extracted from the source tree via
`sphinx.ext.autodoc` + `autosummary`. If a symbol you expect is missing,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/unilabsim/UniLab/issues).

```{note}
Reading this in a *preview* build that says "no API reference"? The build
environment couldn't import `unilab`. Install UniLab in the same venv, or
read this section on the live site.
