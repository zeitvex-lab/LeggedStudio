# Contributing To UniLab

This page summarizes the repository workflow for contributors. Contract and
architecture details live in {doc}`1-architecture/1-overview`.

## Environment

Install dependencies for your platform:

- macOS (MPS, PyPI torch wheel): `uv sync`
- Linux with NVIDIA (PyTorch cu128 wheel): `uv sync`
- Linux AMD / ROCm: `make sync-rocm`, then run commands with `uv run ...`. To
  return to the default CUDA / macOS profile, `git restore -- pyproject.toml
  uv.lock` and re-run `uv sync`.
- Linux Intel XPU: `make sync-xpu`
- Add `--extra motrix` when you need the Motrix backend, e.g. `uv sync --extra
  motrix`.

```bash
uv sync
uv sync --extra motrix
make sync-rocm
make sync-xpu
```

Use `uv run` for commands. Do not invoke `python` directly outside `uv run`.

## Development Rules

- Always use `uv run`. Run `make check` before any code-related commit.
- Do not commit backup or scratch files: no `*.bak`, `*.tmp`, `*.old`, `*.orig`,
  or editor backups ending in `~`.
- Do not add new owner logic to `src/unilab/utils/`. The modules there are a
  transitional shim; lift durable logic to its owner layer or `src/unilab/base/`
  instead.
- Module naming expresses owner responsibility: use singular nouns by default,
  plural only when the semantics are themselves a collection contract, and a
  `_factory` suffix for factory modules.
- Code comments, public API docstrings, internal implementation notes,
  TODO/FIXME entries, and config comments use English by default. Chinese prose
  belongs in the Chinese documentation under `docs/sphinx/source/zh_CN/`, not in
  source comments or config annotations.
- When a change affects a user-visible workflow, keep `README.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and the matching pages under `docs/sphinx/source/en/` and
  `docs/sphinx/source/zh_CN/` in sync.

## Comment Language Policy

- Public API docstrings must describe contracts, arguments, return values, and
  boundary conditions in English.
- Inline comments should explain non-obvious intent, owner boundaries, or
  backend/env/config invariants in English. Delete stale comments instead of
  translating them mechanically.
- TODO/FIXME comments must be English and should name the owner layer or
  dependency that can resolve the follow-up.
- Hydra YAML and example config comments must be English because they are
  reviewed with the source contract.
- Existing mixed-language comments should be migrated in small PRs. Prioritize
  public contracts, backend adapters, env contracts, training runners, config
  schema, and high-traffic tests before lower-risk examples.

## Common Commands

```bash
make format
make type
make check
make test
make test-cov
make test-slow
make test-all
```

For documentation changes, run these focused checks in addition to
`make test-all`:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/scripts/test_check_docs.py -q
cd docs/sphinx
UNILAB_DOCS_SKIP_AUTODOC=1 uv run --no-project --with-requirements requirements.txt sphinx-build -b html -n source build/html
```

The `Docs` GitHub Actions workflow runs the same prose-only build for matching
PRs whose base is `main` and for pushes to `main`. It can also be started from
the GitHub Actions web UI via `workflow_dispatch`. It does not install UniLab
with `pip install -e .`, does
not generate API reference pages, and does not publish the external docs
repository.

For a final local refresh of the full site, including API reference pages for
the `UniLab-doc` publication flow, use a parallel Sphinx build from a synced
developer environment:

```bash
uv sync
uv pip install -r docs/sphinx/requirements.txt
cd docs/sphinx
uv run --no-sync sphinx-build -j auto -b html -n source build/html
```

## Commit And PR Expectations

- Use Conventional Commits such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`,
  `test:`, and `chore:`.
- Use `main` as the base for an ordinary PR. Use the roadmap's
  `dev/issue-<roadmap-number>-<slug>` integration branch as the base for a child
  PR. See {doc}`5-contributing_workflow` for the complete convention.
- Link the driving issue in the PR.
- List the validation commands actually run.
- Pass `make test-all` on the final local head before creating or updating every
  PR.
- State whether behavior differs between MuJoCo, Motrix, macOS, or Linux.
- For code/config changes, run the nearest tests for the changed contract before
  relying on top-level smoke commands.

## Testing

Tests are grouped by owner area under `tests/`:

```text
tests/
├── base/         # registry, backend selection, env contract
├── config/       # Hydra / dataclass / reward injection
├── envs/         # environment configuration and instantiation
├── dr/           # domain-randomization types and managers
├── terrains/     # terrain generators and scene materialization
├── ipc/          # shared-memory and async-runner primitives
├── scripts/      # training-script configs and entrypoint tooling
├── algos/        # runner integration, RSL-RL PPO
├── integration/  # cross-module reward / config integration
├── training/     # training-run helpers
└── utils/        # helpers and experiment tracking
```

Markers and skips:

- Unmarked tests are fast unit / contract / env smoke tests run by `make test`.
- `@pytest.mark.slow` marks full training/script smoke runs or cumulatively
  expensive backend matrices. CI skips them; run them locally with
  `make test-slow`. The `slow` marker is registered in `pyproject.toml`.

Notes for `make test-slow`:

- **Test-only env registration uses a subprocess hook.** Off-policy / APPO
  runners spawn a collector subprocess via `multiprocessing.spawn`, and the
  spawned interpreter **does not execute** `tests/conftest.py`. As a result,
  `DummyFlatTest` and similar test envs cannot live in `conftest` alone.
  `tests/conftest.py` adds `tests._test_registry` to the
  `UNILAB_EXTRA_REGISTRY_PACKAGES` environment variable, and
  `unilab.base.registry.ensure_registries` re-registers those modules inside
  the subprocess. To add a new test env, append its module to
  `__unilab_registry_modules__` in `tests/_test_registry/__init__.py`.
- **Replay memory budget.** Off-policy host shared memory contains only the
  fixed-depth ingress and scales with `num_envs` and transition width, not
  `replay_buffer_n`. The complete ring scales with `replay_buffer_n` on the
  CUDA/MPS learner device. If you see an error like
  `MemoryError: estimated shared-memory allocation … exceeds /dev/shm
  available …`, the host's shared-memory quota cannot fit the default
  ingress. Device-ring allocation failures report the required and available
  accelerator budgets separately.

## CI Workflow

Remote CI is routed by the PR base:

| PR base | Local gate | Remote gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | `make test-all` passes on the final local head | All applicable checks for the current PR head complete successfully |
| Any other branch, including a roadmap integration branch | `make test-all` passes on the final local head | The local result is the complete test gate; a later PR whose actual base is `main` provides remote execution |

A child PR can therefore merge into its integration branch after local
validation and review. A roadmap's final PR returns to its declared base: a
`main` base runs remote integration, while another base continues with the local
gate. Record the actual local commands and results in every PR, and add the
current-head remote status when the base is `main`.

Pull requests to `main` run six jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
`ruff-lint`, `ruff-format`, `mypy`, `pyright`, `benchmark-smoke`, and `test`.
They can also be triggered with `workflow_dispatch` for mainline-boundary
diagnostics. In-progress runs on the same branch are cancelled automatically.

| Job | What it runs |
| --- | --- |
| `ruff-lint` | `uv run --no-sync ruff check --output-format=github .` |
| `ruff-format` | `uv run --no-sync ruff format --check .` |
| `mypy` | `uv run mypy src/unilab` |
| `pyright` | `uv run pyright` |
| `benchmark-smoke` | `uv run --no-sync python scripts/benchmark/smoke_test.py` in a CPU torch environment |
| `test` | `uv sync --extra mujoco --extra motrix` (CPU torch), then `uv run --no-sync pytest -m "not slow" --cov=src/unilab --cov-fail-under=25` |

The `test` job enforces a coverage gate (`--cov-fail-under=25`); the floor only
ratchets up as test guardrails improve. Documentation changes are validated by
`tests/scripts/test_check_docs.py` in the same suite. The separate `Docs`
workflow runs the prose-only Sphinx build.

## Documentation Expectations

- Commands must point to checked-in scripts, package entrypoints, Makefile
  targets, or config owners.
- Backend and task support claims should use evidence grades such as
  `Registered`, `Configured`, `Tested`, `Benchmarked`, or `Recommended`.
- Do not describe `training.sim_backend=<backend>` as a standalone backend
  switch. Use `--sim <backend>` in user-facing commands and select the owner
  YAML path internally.
- Keep English pages free of manual navigation blocks.

## Configuration Changes

Task, backend, reward, and algorithm selection belongs in Hydra owner YAMLs.
When adding or changing a runnable path, update the relevant owner config under
`src/unilab/conf/` and verify script composition with tests under `tests/config/` or
`tests/scripts/`.

See {doc}`2-contracts/3-task_owner` and
{doc}`../2-user_guide/1-training/2-hydra_config`.
