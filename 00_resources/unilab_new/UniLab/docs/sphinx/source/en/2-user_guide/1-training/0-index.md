# Training

Training in UniLab is config-first. Use the package CLI for day-to-day runs and
the script entrypoints when debugging the underlying Hydra composition.
Off-policy SAC, TD3, and FlashSAC runs use one learner device per training
process.

## When to Drop to `scripts/train_*.py`

Day-to-day runs should use the unified CLI. Reach for the low-level
`scripts/train_*.py` entrypoints only when you are:

- debugging a specific training stack,
- observing Hydra compose behavior directly, or
- comparing script-level log directories or adapter behavior.
