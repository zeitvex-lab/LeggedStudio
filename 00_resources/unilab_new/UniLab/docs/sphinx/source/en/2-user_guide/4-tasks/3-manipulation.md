# Manipulation

Manipulation tasks live in `src/unilab/tasks/manipulation/` and the Go2 arm
manip-loco env lives in `src/unilab/tasks/locomotion/go2_arm/`.

## In-Hand

- `allegro_inhand` and `allegro_inhand_grasp` have MuJoCo and Motrix PPO owners.
- `sharpa_inhand`, `sharpa_inhand_grasp`, and the `hora` profile for
  `sharpa_inhand` are MuJoCo owner paths in the current configs.

```bash
uv run train --algo ppo --task allegro_inhand --sim mujoco
uv run train --algo ppo --task allegro_inhand --sim motrix training.no_play=true
uv run train --algo ppo --task sharpa_inhand --sim mujoco --profile hora training.no_play=true
```

HORA student distillation is configured by
`src/unilab/conf/hora_distill/task/sharpa_inhand/mujoco.yaml`; it is not currently exposed
as a separate top-level CLI route.

## Platform Balancing

`stewart_balance` is a 6-DOF parallel (Stewart) platform that balances a free
ball on its top plate. The policy commands a 2-D plate tilt (roll, pitch); an
inverse-kinematics step converts the commanded plate pose into the six prismatic
leg lengths that the position actuators track. The reward combines centering,
zero-velocity progress and a stillness bonus, with a fall penalty; an episode ends
on a fall or on sustained-still success.

The base is welded to the world. Motrix is the validated training backend; the
mujoco owner constructs and steps, but its stiff closed-loop solver is not yet
training-stable under load.

```bash
uv run train --algo ppo --task stewart_balance --sim motrix training.no_play=true
```

## Mobile Manipulation

`go2_arm_manip_loco` is the committed Go2 + Airbot owner path:

```bash
uv run train --algo ppo --task go2_arm_manip_loco --sim mujoco training.no_play=true
```
