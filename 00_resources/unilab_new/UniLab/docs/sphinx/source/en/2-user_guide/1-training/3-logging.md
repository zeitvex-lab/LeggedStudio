# Logging

The terminal panel and TensorBoard / W&B are not separate logging systems. An
algorithm runner submits each metric once to the same training logger. The terminal
refreshes on a fixed 2 Hz clock and shows a two-second sliding average;
`training.logger=tensorboard` (the default) or `training.logger=wandb` selects the
persistent backend, which keeps each unsmoothed iteration value.

This page first covers the log directory shared by all algorithms, then documents the
off-policy terminal used by SAC / TD3 / FlashSAC and APPO. Every terminal field in the
tables maps directly to one backend key; an `_ms` suffix always means milliseconds.

## Log Directory and Backend

Run training with the default TensorBoard backend:

```bash
uv run train --algo ppo --task go2_joystick_flat --sim mujoco
```

Run directories default to `logs/<algo.algo_log_name>/<task>/` unless the selected
stack overrides `training.log_root` or `training.log_dir`:

| Algorithm | Log root | `algo_log_name` source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PPO | `logs/rsl_rl_ppo/<task>/` | `src/unilab/conf/ppo/config.yaml` |
| APPO | `logs/appo/<task>/` | `src/unilab/conf/appo/config.yaml` |
| SAC | `logs/fast_sac/<task>/` | `src/unilab/conf/sac/config.yaml` |
| FlashSAC | `logs/flash_sac/<task>/` | `src/unilab/conf/flashsac/config.yaml` |
| TD3 | `logs/fast_td3/<task>/` | `src/unilab/conf/td3/config.yaml` |

A run directory is named `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<sim_backend>`, for example
`2026-03-09_18-30-00_mujoco`. Common artifacts include `run_config.json`,
`run_summary.json`, checkpoints, and `play_video.mp4` when that run produced one.

Enable W&B with:

```bash
uv run train --algo ppo --task go2_joystick_flat --sim mujoco \
  training.logger=wandb \
  training.wandb_project=unilab
```

Shared fields include `training.wandb_project`, `training.wandb_entity`,
`training.wandb_group`, `training.wandb_name`, `training.wandb_tags`,
`training.wandb_notes`, and `training.wandb_mode`. `ExperimentTracker` writes
`run_config.json` and `run_summary.json`; RSL-RL PPO also connects its writer in W&B
mode. A MuJoCo `play_video.mp4` is uploaded when the run produces one.

## Off-policy Terminal

The bottom of the terminal has three columns:

- `Learner (Iter Wall)` is one learner-main-thread iteration; every percentage uses
  `Iter Wall` as its denominator.
- `Collector (own clock)` is measured in the collector subprocess and runs in
  parallel with the learner.
- `System` contains the buffer size, timeout rate, environment count, and per-rank
  batch size.

The panel-border title reports `GPUs N`. In multi-GPU training, only rank 0 owns the
terminal and persistent logger. Learner metrics and timings are averaged across
ranks first and then across the terminal's two-second window. `Steps/s` and
`Samples/s` are exceptions to the rank average: per-rank collector step rates and
learner sample rates are summed, so both fields are total job throughput. The
`Avg 2s (n=...)` header field gives the number of already rank-reduced learner
samples in the current time window.

Do not add times across the learner and collector columns. Only the learner rows from
`Collector Wait` through `Other` are mutually exclusive main-thread phases. The
implementation fills unnamed intervals with `Other = max(Iter Wall - accounted, 0)`.
Normally the rows sum to `Iter Wall`, so their displayed percentages sum to about
100% (per-row rounding can introduce a small difference). The terminal no longer
hides applicable phases below a 1% threshold: a zero row is kept so it can be matched
directly with TensorBoard / W&B. Algorithm-specific phases neither occupy terminal
rows nor get persisted for other algorithms; for example, `Replay Stage` and
`Weight Publish` exist only for APPO / HORA-APPO.

### Learner Main Timeline

| Terminal field | TensorBoard / W&B key | Path | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Collector Wait | `timing/learner_collector_wait_ms` | All | Learner-main-thread wait to reach this iteration's update boundary; SAC-like paths serve inference requests and continue until replay is ready and the `env_steps_per_sync` tick count is met, while APPO waits for a rollout in the ring |
| Inference | `timing/learner_inference_ms` | Learner-owned inference | Total wall time for observation H2D, actor forward, and action D2H; nested details are listed below |
| Collector Release | `timing/learner_collector_release_ms` | Learner-owned inference | Publishing the action response token; normally short, while blocking means the response queue has not drained |
| Replay Batch Wait | `timing/learner_replay_batch_wait_ms` | Device replay | Waiting for the prefetched device batch to finish ingress commit and gather; near zero on a prefetch hit |
| Replay Stage | `timing/learner_replay_stage_ms` | APPO | Sequentially materializing newly arrived NumPy rollouts from the ring into the learner staging pool; this is an exclusive learner-main-thread phase |
| Replay Sample | `timing/learner_replay_sample_ms` | All | Acquiring the ready batch; usually hot/cold swap plus views on CUDA, with possible slot-event waiting on MPS |
| Train | `timing/learner_train_ms` | All | Learner update-phase wall time |
| Weight Publish | `timing/learner_weight_publish_ms` | APPO | Writing fresh actor / critic weights to shared memory |
| Other | `timing/learner_other_ms` | All | Residual after subtracting the phases above from `Iter Wall`, including metrics drain, reward stats, and loop bookkeeping |
| Iter Wall | `perf/iter_ms` | All | Wall time from learner-loop iteration start through update completion; always shown as 100% |

Backends also record `perf/learner_train_pct`, `perf/learner_accounted_pct`, and
`perf/learner_other_pct`. Accounted time contains only the mutually exclusive
main-thread phases above, never nested or background work. Normally
`accounted + other = 100%`. If a clock anomaly or a future overlapping timer makes
`accounted > Iter Wall`, `Other` is clamped to zero and `accounted_pct > 100%` is a
contract violation to fix, not an interpretable parallel-work percentage.

### Learner Nested and Background Diagnostics

The following keys are persistent-backend diagnostics, not additional `Iter Wall`
slices:

| TensorBoard / W&B key | Parent or execution thread | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timing/learner_inference_h2d_ms` | Child of `Inference` | Observation copy from the shared CPU slot to the learner device |
| `timing/learner_inference_forward_ms` | Child of `Inference` | `learner.actor` inference, including the current device synchronization |
| `timing/learner_inference_d2h_ms` | Child of `Inference` | Action copy into the shared CPU slot |
| `timing/replay_ingress_h2d_submit_ms` | Replay ingress; CUDA daemon or MPS learner thread | CPU-side duration of the latest transition-span submission into the authoritative device ring; it can occur inside any main phase and must not be added to learner percentages |

The three inference details should approximately compose `Inference`; small gaps come
from Python work between timers. `Replay H2D Submit` overlaps the learner timeline:
CUDA submits non-blocking copies from the `replay_gpu_resident_sync` daemon, while MPS
advances them from existing learner calls. Use a trace for the real asynchronous GPU
copy / gather interval instead of treating submit wall time as extra iteration share.

### Tags in Existing Runs

Historical TensorBoard event files are not rewritten. New runs use the canonical
tags below, while an existing run continues to show its old names:

| Old tag | New tag | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timing/inference_total_ms` | `timing/learner_inference_ms` | Match terminal `Inference` and identify the owner |
| `timing/inference_{h2d,forward,d2h}_ms` | `timing/learner_inference_{h2d,forward,d2h}_ms` | Put all three nested items in the learner namespace |
| `timing/learner_incremental_h2d_ms` (SAC-like) | `timing/replay_ingress_h2d_submit_ms` | Identify a potentially parallel submit diagnostic rather than a learner main phase |
| `timing/learner_incremental_h2d_ms` (APPO) | `timing/learner_replay_stage_ms` | Identify synchronous staging that is part of `Iter Wall` |
| `timing/collector_inference_wait_ms` | `timing/collector_learner_action_wait_ms` | The wait can include the remaining learner update, not only inference latency |

`perf/learner_pipeline_ms` was removed because it mixed exclusive main phases with a
background H2D submission. Use `perf/iter_ms` for the main timeline and reconcile it
with `perf/learner_accounted_pct` plus `perf/learner_other_pct`.

### Collector Timeline

SAC / TD3 / FlashSAC record four mutually exclusive hot-path phases per vectorized
env tick. Terminal percentages use `perf/collector_cycle_ms`, the sum of these four
phases:

| Terminal field | TensorBoard / W&B key | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inference Request | `timing/collector_inference_request_ms` | Publish observations / dones to the shared slot and notify the learner |
| Learner Action Wait | `timing/collector_learner_action_wait_ms` | Barrier wall time from request publication until the learner publishes this tick's action |
| Env Step | `timing/collector_env_step_ms` | `env.step()` wall time |
| Replay Write | `timing/collector_replay_write_ms` | Transition post-processing, packing, and bounded-ingress write |

`Learner Action Wait` is deliberately not named “Inference Wait”: it is not pure
inference latency. If the collector finishes `Env Step + Replay Write` and submits its
next request while the learner is still updating, the value includes the remaining
update, a small scheduling part of the next learner `Collector Wait`, and the next
`Inference + Collector Release`. A long value therefore agrees with parallel
execution: it means the collector reached the next barrier before the learner.

The persistent `perf/collector_active_steps_per_sec` diagnostic is calculated as
`num_envs / (Inference Request + Env Step + Replay Write)`. It intentionally excludes
`Learner Action Wait`; low-value sub-millisecond episode / metrics bookkeeping is no
longer timed separately. The terminal `Steps/s` field instead reports total
synchronized collector throughput. The indented Backend Step / Update State / Reset
Done rows are nested `Env Step` details. They do not enter the cycle sum, though their
displayed percentages use the same collector-cycle denominator.

APPO has a different collection contract and reports:

| Terminal field | TensorBoard / W&B key | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MLP Infer | `timing/collector_mlp_infer_ms` | Per-step policy-inference EMA |
| Env Step | `timing/collector_env_step_ms` | Single-`env.step()` EMA |
| Rollout Wall | `timing/collector_rollout_ms` | Whole `steps_per_env` rollout wall-time EMA |

These are not one percentage breakdown: the first two are per-step EMAs and `Rollout
Wall` is a whole-rollout total, so the terminal shows milliseconds only. The backend
active-throughput diagnostic is `(num_envs * steps_per_env) / Rollout Wall`.

## FastSAC Dual Timeline

With the default `training.env_steps_per_sync=1`, this sequence starts at learner
iteration `k`. Horizontal messages are synchronization points; the `par` branches are
the actual overlap:

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Collector (CPU / NumPy Env)
    participant I as Inference Slot + Queue
    participant L as Learner Main Thread
    participant D as Device Replay / CUDA Daemon

    Note over C,L: iteration k starts with request(t) already published
    C->>I: Inference Request(t)
    I-->>L: Collector Wait ends
    rect rgb(235, 245, 255)
        L->>I: Inference: observation H2D
        L->>L: learner.actor forward
        L->>I: action D2H
        L-->>C: Collector Release / response(t)
    end

    par Collector tick t
        C->>C: Env Step(t)
        C->>D: Replay Write(t)
        C->>I: Inference Request(t+1)
        Note over C,I: Learner Action Wait(t+1) starts here
    and Learner iteration k
        L->>D: Replay Batch Wait + Replay Sample(k)
        L->>L: Train(k): fixed updates_per_step
        Note over D,L: replay-ingress H2D / gather may overlap Train in background
    end

    I-->>L: iteration k+1 Collector Wait ends
    L->>I: Inference(t+1)
    L-->>C: response(t+1), ending Learner Action Wait
```

The important relationships are:

- Learner `Inference(t)` is the final part of collector `Learner Action Wait(t)`;
  they are not expected to have equal duration.
- `Env Step(t) + Replay Write(t)` overlaps learner replay work and `Train(k)`.
- The next request may arrive before `Train(k)` finishes, but the learner serves it
  only after the complete update. `Learner Action Wait(t+1)` can therefore be long
  while the next learner `Collector Wait` remains near zero.
- Inference does not overlap learner updates; each tick uses a complete
  `policy_version`.

## APPO Dual Timeline

The APPO collector continuously produces rollouts while the learner consumes complete
ring-buffer slots:

```{mermaid}

    title One APPO learner iteration (schematic scale)
    dateFormat x
    axisFormat %S

    section Collector (separate process)
    rollout N+1: MLP Infer + Env Step + other collection work :active, c0, 0, 18000

    section Ring Buffer
    rollout N ready   :milestone, r0, 0, 0
    rollout N+1 ready :milestone, r1, 18000, 18000

    section Learner (Iter Wall)
    Collector Wait          :done,   l0, 0, 1000
    Replay Stage            :        l1, 1000, 3000
    Replay Sample           :        l2, 3000, 4000
    Train                   :active, l3, 4000, 16000
    Weight Publish          :crit,   l4, 16000, 18000

    section Learner Total
    Iter Wall               :        l5, 0, 18000
```

Collector rollout and learner `Iter Wall` are independent, overlapping timelines and
must not be added. `Collector Wait` is near zero when the ring already contains a
slot. Collector `Rollout Wall` may be greater than, equal to, or less than one learner
`Iter Wall`, depending on ring backlog and relative throughput.

`Replay Stage` is the main-thread work that inserts every newly arrived slot into the
staging pool. `Replay Sample` then combines a training batch from that pool. They are
adjacent, additive learner phases, not background H2D diagnostics.

## Diagnosing Bottlenecks

| Observation | Direct meaning | Check first |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Learner `Collector Wait` is high | The collector's data / request is not ready when the learner reaches iteration start | Env step, transition post-processing, collector liveness, and IPC |
| Collector `Learner Action Wait` is high while learner `Collector Wait` is low | Collector reaches the next barrier first and waits for update completion plus inference | `Train`, `updates_per_step`, and batch size; then inference details |
| Learner `Inference` is high | The learner-owned action path itself is slow | H2D / forward / D2H children |
| Learner `Replay Batch Wait` is high | Device-replay prefetch misses the consumption point | Ingress commit, side-stream gather, and GPU contention |
| Collector `Replay Write` is high | Bounded-ingress write or transition post-processing slows down | Exhausted ingress slots and delayed device commit |
| `Replay H2D Submit` is high but main phases are normal | Background submission diagnostic grew; it did not add the same wall time to the iteration | GPU copy, ingress commit, and overlap in Perfetto |

## Trace Options

Off-policy configs expose `training.trace_enabled`, `training.trace_output_dir`,
`training.trace_thread_time`, and `training.trace_cuda_events`. Scalar logs answer how
long each iteration took. Use the generated Perfetto timeline to determine whether
asynchronous H2D, device gather, collector, and learner work actually overlap.
