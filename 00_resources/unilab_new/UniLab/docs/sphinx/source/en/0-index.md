# UniLab

### Contract-driven robot learning infrastructure for CPU simulation and accelerator learning.

{bdg-primary}`Python >=3.10,<3.14` {bdg-secondary}`Hydra owner YAML` {bdg-info}`MuJoCo + Motrix` {bdg-success}`uv workflow`

UniLab routes robot RL through the `uv run train` / `uv run eval` CLI,
task-owner Hydra configs, and backend contracts. Use the landing page to
install, run a smoke training job, choose an algorithm/backend, or jump into
deployment and extension docs.

## Why UniLab

::::{grid} 1 1 3 3
:gutter: 3

:::{grid-item-card} CPU simulation, accelerator learning
The README describes UniLab as CPU physics simulation connected to policy
training through shared memory, with MuJoCo and Motrix as simulation backends.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Backend choice stays in config
Switch backends with CLI flags such as `--task go2_joystick_flat --sim motrix`;
the CLI composes the matching owner YAML under `src/unilab/conf/`. Do not use
`training.sim_backend` as a standalone backend switch.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Deployment paths are documented
The deployment docs cover sim-to-real, sim-to-sim, ONNX/runtime export, safety
layers, and robot-specific notes for G1, Go2, and Allegro.

## Quick Install And Smoke Run

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
git clone https://github.com/unilabsim/UniLab.git
cd UniLab
uv sync --extra motrix
uv run train --algo ppo --task go2_joystick_flat --sim motrix \
  algo.max_iterations=1 algo.num_envs=16 training.no_play=true
```

For the full README-style walkthrough, see {doc}`1-getting_started/1-quick_demo`.
For platform-specific setup, see {doc}`1-getting_started/2-installation`.

## Start where you are

::::{grid} 1 1 2 3
:gutter: 3

:::{grid-item-card} Install the repo
:link: 1-getting_started/2-installation
:link-type: doc
Set up `uv`, sync dependencies, and pick the platform profile that matches your
machine.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Run or replay training
:link: 1-getting_started/1-quick_demo
:link-type: doc
Start with PPO on Go2, then move to evaluation, playback, or checkpoint resume.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Choose a backend
:link: 2-user_guide/3-backends/3-choosing_a_backend
:link-type: doc
Compare MuJoCo and Motrix through task owner YAMLs and backend capability docs.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Pick an algorithm
:link: 2-user_guide/2-algorithms/0-index
:link-type: doc
Compare PPO, APPO, SAC, TD3, FlashSAC, HIM-PPO, and HORA entrypoints.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Deploy or switch sims
:link: 3-deployment/1-sim_to_real/1-overview
:link-type: doc
Follow sim-to-real checklists or use the sim-to-sim docs to swap MuJoCo and
Motrix.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} Extend safely
:link: 4-developer_guide/0-index
:link-type: doc
Read the env, backend, runner, registry, and task-owner contracts before adding
tasks, backends, algorithms, or terrain.

## Hardware And Algorithm Coverage

This snapshot only lists coverage backed by checked-in scripts, owner YAMLs, and
the generated support-matrix evidence grades. The repository currently has no
committed benchmark manifest or separate recommendation metadata.

| Robot / task family | Algorithm paths with repo evidence | Backend evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Go1 joystick | PPO, APPO, TD3 | PPO has tested MuJoCo and Motrix rows. APPO has tested MuJoCo rows and Motrix registered rows. TD3 has a Motrix owner YAML for `go1_joystick_flat`. |
| Go2 joystick | PPO, FlashSAC, TD3 | PPO has tested MuJoCo and Motrix rows. FlashSAC has MuJoCo owner YAMLs for `go2_joystick_flat`; TD3 has a Motrix owner YAML for `go2_joystick_flat`. |
| Go2 arm manip-loco | PPO, HIM-PPO | Committed MuJoCo owner YAMLs are present under `src/unilab/conf/ppo/task/go2_arm_manip_loco/` and `src/unilab/conf/ppo_him/task/go2_arm_manip_loco/`. |
| Go2W joystick | PPO | PPO owner YAMLs exist for MuJoCo and Motrix flat/rough variants under `src/unilab/conf/ppo/task/go2w_joystick_*`. |
| G1 locomotion / tracking | PPO, APPO, SAC, TD3 | PPO, APPO, and SAC include committed MuJoCo and Motrix owner YAMLs for G1 tasks; TD3 has a `g1_walk_flat` MuJoCo owner. |
| Allegro in-hand | PPO, APPO | PPO and APPO have committed MuJoCo and Motrix owner YAMLs for Allegro in-hand tasks. |
| Sharpa in-hand | PPO, APPO HORA teacher, HORA distillation | Sharpa owner YAMLs are committed for PPO/APPO teacher paths; student distillation uses `src/unilab/conf/hora_distill/task/sharpa_inhand/mujoco.yaml`. |
