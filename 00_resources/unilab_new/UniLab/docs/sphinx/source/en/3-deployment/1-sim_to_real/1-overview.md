# Sim-to-Real Overview

This page is the *map* of UniLab's sim-to-real workflow. Every subsequent
page in this section drills into one stage.

## What "sim-to-real" means in UniLab

A deployable UniLab policy is the exported policy plus the exact observation
and action contracts used by the selected task owner. UniLab ships the training
side and the ONNX export; every robot needs a hardware-side runtime that:

1. Reads sensors → assembles the **same observation vector** the policy saw
   in simulation.
2. Runs `policy.onnx` through a runtime that supports the exported graph.
3. Maps the action vector to the same actuator interface used by the env's
   `SimBackend`.

If any of those three things drifts between sim and deployment, debug the
contract first before changing reward or hardware tuning.

## What you should have before starting

::::{admonition} Pre-flight checklist
:class: note

1. A **converged training run** with stable reward AND a stable success
   criterion (motion tracking error, drop count, etc.).
2. The same policy passes evaluation in **both** MuJoCo and Motrix when both
   support the task — if not, you have a backend-dependent reward leak; see
   {doc}`../2-sim_to_sim/4-reward_parity`.
3. **Domain randomization** ranges large enough that reward varies smoothly
   when you sweep DR strength — a brittle policy in sim is a brittle policy
   on hardware.
4. **No backend feature leakage** in the env — verify via the developer
   guide's {doc}`../../4-developer_guide/2-contracts/2-backend_contract`.
5. An **observation spec** you can implement on hardware. If your policy
   reads `body_lin_vel`, you need a deploy-side estimator or a task owner
   variant that removes that signal from the actor input.

## The most common failure modes

- **Observation drift.** Sensor pre-processing differs between sim and deploy
  runtime (units, frame, filter cutoffs). Log the first deploy-side
  observation window and compare it with a sim rollout built from the same
  owner YAML.
- **Action latency.** Some task owners expose one-step delayed action execution
  through a control config or Manager-Based action term. Measure the deploy loop
  and make the training owner match that contract before a hardware run. See
  {doc}`8-latency_budget`.
- **Friction / damping mismatch.** Especially for in-hand manipulation.
  Sweep friction in DR; cross-check via {doc}`../2-sim_to_sim/3-contact_and_friction_alignment`.
- **Reset transients.** Sim resets to a stable pose; deployment starts from a
  controller state. The safety layer must reject malformed observations and
  unsafe actions before they reach the motor driver.
