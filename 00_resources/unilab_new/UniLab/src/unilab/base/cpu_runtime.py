"""Process-local CPU confinement for envs that own an explicit CPU block.

Multi-rank off-policy data-parallel runs partition host CPUs so each rank's
collector owns one contiguous block (``training.dp_collector_cpu_ids``, routed
into ``EnvCfg.cpu_ids``). The MuJoCo BatchEnvPool already pins its physics
workers to that block, but the collector's host-side compute did not follow:
Numba parallel kernels (``unilab.base.backend.body_state`` and the
motion-tracking kernels) size their pool from the host CPU count and leave
placement to the OS, so they drift across rank boundaries and compete with
sibling ranks' pinned physics workers.

``apply_env_cpu_runtime`` is the generic env-level counterpart, applied once on
the env-construction cold path — before managers, backend materialization, or
the first Numba parallel call exist:

- ``os.sched_setaffinity`` pins the calling thread to the block, and every
  already-running thread (e.g. BLAS pools spawned at ``import numpy``) is
  pinned individually via ``/proc/self/task``; threads spawned later
  (including Numba's lazily-launched pool) inherit the mask.
- ``numba.set_num_threads(len(cpu_ids))`` sizes Numba's pool to the block
  instead of the host, unless the operator pinned ``NUMBA_NUM_THREADS``
  (mirroring the motion-kernel runtime policy).

The function is backend-agnostic: ``EnvCfg.cpu_ids`` is the single source of
truth, so any backend whose env declares a block gets the same confinement.
