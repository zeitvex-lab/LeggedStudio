//! `robotctl configure` — edit `robotd.toml` without reading a wall of comments.
//!
//! The shipped `deploy/robotd.toml` is deliberately exhaustive: every key, documented at
//! paragraph length, all of it commented out. That is the right *reference* and a poor
//! *editing surface* — finding the one switch you want means scrolling four hundred lines of
//! prose. This is the editing surface: every key the daemon knows, the feature switches first,
//! current value against default, one line of doc, toggle and type in place.
//!
//! ## Where the truth lives
//!
//! Nothing here defines a key. The schema, the defaults, the validation and the one-line docs
//! all come from `robotd-params` — the same crate `robotd` itself parses the file with — and
//! its registry is pinned complete by a test over `Params`'s own serialization. When a section
//! is added to the daemon, this editor learns it at compile time or the build fails; it can be
//! wrong about nothing.
//!
//! ## How edits are applied
//!
//! The file is parsed with `toml_edit`, which preserves everything it does not touch —
//! comments, ordering, keys from releases this build does not know. Edits set or remove
//! exactly the keys changed. Before anything is written, the candidate is re-parsed through
//! `Params::load` — the daemon's own gate, range checks included — so this tool cannot write a
//! file `robotd` would refuse to start on.
//!
//! That preservation and that gate used to contradict each other, and the contradiction was
//! reachable: a board carrying a section from a branch kept it here by design, and then `load`
//! rejected the whole file, so no edit could be saved at all until someone deleted a section that
//! did nothing. `load` now names unknown keys and ignores them, which makes both halves true at
//! once. Typos are still caught, one layer up: this only ever writes keys the registry knows.
//!
//! Writes are atomic (temp file + rename beside the target), because half a config at the
//! moment of a power cut is a robot that will not start.
//!
//! ## Restart
//!
//! The daemons read the file **once at startup** (`robotd-params` docs) — so every change
//! requires a restart, and the exit flow offers one whenever anything was written. *Which*
//! daemon is derived from the keys that changed, not assumed: `[media]` is `mediad` reading the
//! same file, and a "restart robotd" offer over a video setting is an edit that reads as having
//! done nothing at all. [`unit_for`] is that mapping and [`units_for`] applies it.
//!
//! The file is root-owned; run as `sudo robotctl configure` to actually write.
