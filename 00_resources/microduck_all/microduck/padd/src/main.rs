//! `padd` — a gamepad, as an intent client.
//!
//! It has no privileged access to the robot. It reads a pad, turns sticks and buttons into
//! intents, and sends them over `robotd`'s socket like any other client.
//!
//! That is the point of it being a separate process rather than a thread inside `robotd`.
//! The intent API is the path the app, the SDK and any remote client will use, and here it
//! gets exercised every day by whoever is working on the robot — so it cannot quietly rot
//! the way an API only the phone app uses inevitably would. The cost is a socket hop: tens
//! of microseconds against a 20 ms tick.
//!
//! ## The mapping is the prototype's
//!
//! Muscle memory carries over from `microduck_runtime`:
//!
//! ```text
//! Start        toggle the policy
//! Y (North)    head mode — sticks pose the head
//! B (East)     body-pose mode — sticks lean and crouch the standing robot
//! A (South)    ground pick
//! LB / RB      left / right kick
//! DPad-Down    sit ↔ stand
//! RT / LT      mouth (either trigger; the max wins) · RT quacks · LT rides the wheee
//! Select, 2 s  sit down, then power off
//! ```
//!
//! Head and body-pose mode both zero the velocity while active, as the prototype does — a
//! robot that keeps walking because you started posing its head is a bad surprise.
//!
//! Smoothing lives in `robotd` (`[control] cmd_alpha` / `head_alpha`), not here: this
//! process sends raw targets, so every client gets the same feel.
//!
//! ## Roller mode
//!
//! At startup this asks `robot.mode`. On a roller robot the stick mapping becomes the
//! prototype's roller preset — asymmetric forward/brake (0.6 / 0.5), no strafe, ±0.3 rad/s
//! heading — and A triggers the crouch that lives in the ground-pick slot. The other
//! skills ride along on wheels, as the rebased roller line has them.
//!
//! ## On the robot, this runs itself
//!
//! `padd.service` starts at boot and stays up whether or not a pad is present, so driving takes one
//! step and it is a pairing step: `sudo robotctl pad pair`, with the pad in pairing mode. The
//! pad is bonded *and trusted*, so it reconnects by itself afterwards, and this process picks it up
//! within a tick.
//!
//! Waiting with no pad is deliberately cheap and deliberately silent — nothing is sent, and
//! `robotd`'s deadman holds the robot on its own. Inventing a zero command instead would mask a
//! disconnected pad as someone's decision to stop.
//!
//! Pairing is **not** done here: bonding a device needs root and BlueZ, and a `padd` holding
//! either would stop being the unprivileged client whose whole value is having no special
//! access. It lives in `configd`, next to wifi.
//!
//! ## It also hands out the pad's raw input
//!
//! One socket, read-only, for `pad.input` and nothing else — `src/tap.rs`, and it does not make this
//! a privileged process. It exists because `padd` is the reason a stalled radio is invisible: the
//! sticks are *polled*, so the last known value keeps being sent at 50 Hz whether or not the pad is
//! still talking, and every surface downstream then shows a robot with a live driver. The event
//! stream one layer below has the evidence, so it is passed out unaltered rather than summarised.
//! `robotctl monitor` draws it; `docs/robot/pair-a-gamepad.md` says how to read it.
//!
//! For development against a board: `ssh -L /tmp/robotd.sock:/run/robotd.sock duck`, then
//! point `--socket` at the forwarded path. Pad on your laptop, robot on the bench, no code.
//! `systemctl stop padd` first, or two processes fight over the sticks. Run that way, `--tap-socket`
//! wants a path you can write — `/run/padd/` belongs to the unit — and on a Mac there is no tap at
//! all, since it reads evdev.
