//! The ONNX policies.
//!
//! Walking and standing are chosen by the magnitude of the velocity command, exactly as
//! `microduck_runtime` does; the skill networks — sit↔stand, ground pick, the two kicks —
//! are selected explicitly by the scheduler in `robotd`, which owns the priority rules.
//! Every network shares the one 61-D observation layout, so a skill is a session choice
//! plus a command-block encoding, never a new contract.
//!
//! **Everything is validated at load, not at inference.** A bundle with the wrong
//! observation width, the wrong action count, or a missing ONNX Runtime must fail while the
//! robot is standing still and the caller can be told why — not sixty ticks later, mid
//! stride. `robotd` turns a load failure into "hold the pose and report unhealthy", so the
//! updater rolls the release back instead of leaving a robot that cannot walk.
