//! `robotd`'s startup parameters: the schema, the defaults, and the validation.
//!
//! A file rather than a wall of CLI flags — the prototype grew 142 of them and most were
//! variants, dead skills and dead sensors, all of which are gone. **Read once at startup,
//! not watched**; live reload is deferred (`docs/design/robotd-design.md` §4.2). That fact
//! is load-bearing for tooling: *any* change to the file requires a `robotd` restart, so an
//! editor never has to ask which keys are live.
//!
//! It lives outside `releases/<ver>/` so it survives an update *and* a rollback: this is
//! per-robot configuration, not shipped defaults (`architecture.md` §3).
//!
//! A crate of its own rather than a module of `robotd`, for one consumer: `robotctl
//! configure` edits the file interactively, and doing that against a copied schema is how a
//! copied schema drifts. [`registry`] is the machine-readable index of every key — what it
//! is, what it defaults to, what values it takes — and its completeness is enforced by a
//! test that walks [`Params`]'s own serialization, so a new section cannot be added without
//! the registry (and therefore the editor) learning about it.

/// **Why unknown keys are no longer fatal.** They were, and the reasoning was sound as far as it
/// went: a silently ignored `min_acheived_hz` leaves an operator believing they moved a threshold
/// they did not. What that argument missed is the other way a key becomes unknown — the build
/// changed underneath a file nobody typed into. A robot running a branch had `[chorale]` in its
/// `robotd.toml`; updating it to a `main` without that feature produced a `robotd` that would not
/// start, four consecutive rollbacks, and a bench session spent on a robot that was fine. The
/// section was inert. Refusing to run over it is a far larger penalty than the mistake it guards
/// against, and it lands on exactly the transitions — a downgrade, a branch, a release that
/// dropped a feature — where the operator did nothing wrong at all.
///
/// So the value is kept and the enforcement moved: every dropped key is named at `warn`, and
/// `robotctl configure` writes only keys the registry knows. What is gone is a robot that will
/// not walk because of a line in a config file that does nothing.
///
/// **The registry is the authority on what a key is**, not serde. It has to be: serde's answer

/// directions, so a key the registry does not know is a key `Params` does not have.
