RL training environments for [Microduck](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck) —
a ~800 g, ~25 cm tall bipedal robot — built on
[mjlab](https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab) (MuJoCo Warp) with PPO.
Policies are trained here at 50 Hz, exported to ONNX, and deployed on the real
robot by the runtime in [pollen-robotics/microduck](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck).

The repo encodes the full sim2real recipe: [BAM](https://github.com/Rhoban/bam)
actuator physics, domain randomization, backlash simulation, and the
reward-design lessons that made it work
(see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the distilled playbook).

## Quickstart

Requires a CUDA GPU (training runs through MuJoCo Warp) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

> **On ARM boxes (DGX Spark / GB10, Jetson):** `uv sync` pulls ~2 GB of CUDA
> wheels on first run and uv's default 30 s HTTP timeout can abort mid-download.
> Export `UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=600` for the first sync. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pollen-robotics/microduck_rl
cd microduck_rl

# train the walking policy (uses your GPU; ~1-2 h for a usable gait at 4096 envs)
uv run train Mjlab-Velocity-Flat-MicroDuck --env.scene.num-envs 4096

# watch a trained policy in the viewer
uv run play Mjlab-Velocity-Flat-MicroDuck --wandb-run-path <entity/project/run_id>

# export to ONNX for deployment
uv run scripts/export.py Mjlab-Velocity-Flat-MicroDuck --wandb-run-path <...>

# drive the exported policy in CPU MuJoCo with the keyboard
uv run scripts/infer_policy.py --walking output.onnx
```

Resume from a checkpoint:

```bash
uv run train Mjlab-Velocity-Flat-MicroDuck --env.scene.num-envs 4096 \
    --agent.run-name resume --agent.load-checkpoint model_29999.pt --agent.resume True
```

No GPU? Add `--hf-jobs` to any train command to run it on Hugging Face Jobs
instead of locally (see [scripts/hf/README.md](scripts/hf/README.md)).

## Tasks

`uv run list-envs` prints the live registry. Flat/Rough variants exist where noted.

<!-- SHOWCASE GRID — one short GIF per task family (sim or real), 3 per row.
     Priority order if you only record a few: Velocity, VelStand (fall+recover),
     Roulade, SitStand, Rollers/Swizzle, BallKick. -->

| Task id | Terrain | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Mjlab-Velocity-{Flat,Rough}-MicroDuck` | flat/rough | **The main task**: walking with velocity commands + head-pose commands |
| `Mjlab-VelStand-{Flat,Rough}-MicroDuck` | flat/rough | Walking + fall recovery in one policy |
| `Mjlab-StandUp-{Flat,Rough}-MicroDuck` | flat/rough | Stand up from face-down/face-up/sitting, then hold the stand + body-pose control |
| `Mjlab-SitStand-{Flat,Rough}-MicroDuck` | flat/rough | Commanded sit ↔ stand in one policy, gently, head commandable |
| `Mjlab-GroundPick-{Flat,Rough}-MicroDuck` | flat/rough | Crouch and touch the ground with the mouth tip, return to stand |
| `Mjlab-BallKick-Flat-MicroDuck` | flat | Kick a 70 mm / 15 g ball forward (actor is ball-blind) |
| `Mjlab-Roulade-Flat-MicroDuck` | flat | Forward roll over the head, land back on the feet |
| `Mjlab-Velocity-Flat-MicroDuck-Rollers` | flat | Roller-skate velocity tracking (passive wheels under the feet) |
| `Mjlab-Velocity-Swizzle-MicroDuck` | flat | Classic symmetric swizzle skating |
| `Mjlab-RollerCrouch-Flat-MicroDuck` | flat | Crouch while gliding on rollers |
| `Mjlab-RollerSlope-Flat-MicroDuck` | slope | Glide down slopes on rollers |
| `Mjlab-RollerStandUp-Flat-MicroDuck` | flat | Stand up from the ground onto the wheels |
| `Mjlab-Spin-Flat-MicroDuck` | flat | Fast spin in place on rollers |

At deployment the runtime hot-swaps these policies (walk / recover / trick)
behind a shared 61-dimensional observation contract, so any of them can take
over the robot at any moment. `scripts/infer_policy.py` rehearses exactly that:

```bash
uv run scripts/infer_policy.py --walking walk.onnx --standing stand.onnx \
    --sitstand sitstand.onnx --roulade roulade.onnx --new-cmd-obs
```

Keyboard-driven (velocity commands, `G` ground pick, `Y` sit/stand, `R` roulade,
`K`/`L` kicks); `--debug`, `--save-csv`, `--record` support sim2real comparisons.

### Backlash variants

Every main task has a **Backlash** twin that trains on a model with ±1° of gear
play (2° total) in series with each of the 14 servo joints: insert `-Backlash`
before `MicroDuck` in the task id, e.g. `Mjlab-Velocity-Flat-Backlash-MicroDuck`.

The backlash is modeled properly for sim2real: each servo gets an unactuated
`passive_<joint>_backlash` hinge, and because the real encoder sits on the
output side of the play, both the firmware PD emulation
(`BacklashEncoderBamActuator`) and the `joint_pos`/`joint_vel` observations
read *through* the backlash (`qpos[servo] + qpos[backlash]`). Observation and
action dims are unchanged, so ONNX export and the runtime need no changes.
See `src/mjlab_microduck/tasks/backlash.py`.

## Actuator model

All tasks use the [BAM](https://github.com/Rhoban/bam) M6 actuator model for
the Dynamixel XL330 (voltage control law, back-EMF, Coulomb/Stribeck/load-dependent
friction), with per-env domain randomization on battery voltage, voltage sag
under load, command delay, and friction magnitude
(`FrictionDRBamActuator` in `src/mjlab_microduck/actuator/`).

At this scale — tiny servos driving a ~800 g biped — actuator fidelity is most
of the sim2real gap, which is why the actuator is modeled down to its voltage
control law instead of an ideal PD.

## Robot models

MJCF models live in `src/mjlab_microduck/robot/microduck/` and are exported
from Onshape with [onshape-to-robot](https://github.com/Rhoban/onshape-to-robot),
one `config_mjcf_*.json` per model:

| XML | Used by |
|---|---|
| `robot_walk.xml` | Velocity (stripped trunk/head contacts — falling is cheap) |
| `robot_allcollisions.xml` | VelStand, StandUp, SitStand, GroundPick, BallKick, Roulade (body can physically lie on the ground) |
| `robot_allcollisions_rollers.xml` | Roller tasks (passive wheels) |
| `robot_*_backlash.xml` | Backlash task variants (generated by `add_backlash.py`) |

`scene*.xml` files wrap the robots with a floor + keyframes (STAND/SIT/FOLD)
for quick viewing and for `infer_policy.py`.

`microduck.urdf` is the portable articulated walking model generated from
`robot_walk.xml`. Its mesh paths are relative to the model directory. Regenerate
and validate it after changing the source MJCF:

```bash
cd src/mjlab_microduck/robot/microduck
python mjcf_to_urdf.py robot_walk.xml microduck.urdf
check_urdf microduck.urdf
```

Conventions worth knowing:

- The observation layout is shared across every policy (61-dim actor obs:
  48 proprioception + commands `[twist(3), head_pose(4), body_pose(6)]`), which
  is what makes runtime policy hot-swapping possible. Envs that don't use a
  command slot zero-pad it rather than dropping it.
- Unactuated joints are all named `passive_*` (roller wheels, backlash
  hinges); actuators, joint observations and pose rewards select servo joints
  with `^(?!passive_).*`.
- Domain-randomization toggles are `ENABLE_*` booleans at the top of each
  env cfg file.
- Joint layout (14 servos): 0–4 left leg (hip_yaw, hip_roll, hip_pitch, knee,
  ankle), 5–8 neck/head (neck_pitch, head_pitch, head_yaw, head_roll),
  9–13 right leg.
- The exporter bakes the observation normalizer into the ONNX graph — always
  deploy ONNX produced by `scripts/export.py`, never a hand-converted
  checkpoint, or the policy sees unnormalized observations at runtime.

[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) documents the env-building workflow and the reward-design
rules learned across the project (also aimed at AI coding agents working in
this repo).

## Tests

```bash
uv run --with pytest pytest tests/
```

CPU-only config-invariant and reward-function regression tests — they lock in
joint-index mappings, reward sign conventions, and NaN guards.
