//! LoopCloser — detect submap-to-submap loop closures via scan matching.
//!
//! Triggered after a submap closes. For each older submap whose anchor
//! is within `radius_m` of the new submap's anchor (and not the
//! immediate predecessor — that's already captured by the odom edge),
//! match several of the new submap's stored raw scans against the older
//! submap's grid (coarse correlative search, then Gauss-Newton refine).
//!
//! A closure is emitted only when it survives ALL of:
//!   * per-scan gates — final-pose residual ≤ `max_residual_m`,
//!     ≥ `min_beams_used` beams, and ≥ `min_coverage` of the scan's
//!     valid beams landing near mapped walls (an aliased pose can score
//!     a great residual on a small agreeing subset while most beams
//!     disagree);
//!   * cross-scan consistency — every verified scan must imply the same
//!     corrected anchor within `verify_max_spread_m` / `_rad`. One
//!     45°-FOV scan is far too weak a witness on its own: a single
//!     aliased match warps the whole graph;
//!   * a correction floor — edges that agree with the current graph
//!     estimate within `min_correction_m` / `_rad` are dropped. They
//!     cannot fix anything; they only inject scan-match noise into the
//!     optimizer, which shows up as wavy walls when submaps freeze
//!     every few seconds in a small room.
