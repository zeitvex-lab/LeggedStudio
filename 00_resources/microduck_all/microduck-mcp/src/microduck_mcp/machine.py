"""The behavior machine: guarded states over the sensed digest, 50 Hz.

Ocarina's pattern (SURFACE.md/MACHINE.md in ~/Code/ocarina) ported to a robot:
the agent never streams commands — it arms a machine whose leaves are
deterministic behaviors executed at the control rate, with transitions guarded
by expressions over the SENSED digest. Fairness by construction: the guard
vocabulary contains only what the robot could genuinely know — camera-derived
ball sighting, proprioception, its own machine state — never the simulator's
ground-truth ball position.

Machine source is TOML (stdlib tomllib; no new dependencies), living in a git
repo the agent edits and hot-swaps via the `machine` socket command family.
Guards are expression strings compiled through the ast module against a strict
whitelist: dotted digest paths, numeric/string/bool literals, comparisons,
and/or/not. Nothing else parses, so nothing else runs.
