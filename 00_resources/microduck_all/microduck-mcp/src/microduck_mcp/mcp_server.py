"""MCP server exposing the Microduck sim as tools.

Stdio MCP server (Python MCP SDK v2); each tool forwards an intent to the sim
server's Unix socket (start it first: `duck-sim`). Register with any MCP
client, e.g.:

    claude mcp add duck -- uv --directory /path/to/microduck-mcp run duck-mcp

Design notes (see docs/mcp-design-notes.md for the research behind this):
tools — not resources — are the interface, including for reads: agent-driven
state polling and camera frames are tool-shaped, and tools are the one MCP
primitive every client supports. Results use typed structured output; errors
the model should see and recover from are raised as ToolError.
