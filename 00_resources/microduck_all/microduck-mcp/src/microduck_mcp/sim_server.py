"""Socket-controlled Microduck MuJoCo simulator.

Runs the same CPU MuJoCo + ONNX policy stack as microduck_rl's
scripts/infer_policy.py (whose PolicyInference class is imported directly from
that repo), but replaces terminal-keyboard control with a Unix-socket JSON-lines
control plane — the same shape as the real robot's robotd socket: clients send
intents, never motor writes.

Every MuJoCo call happens on the sim thread. Socket connections enqueue
requests; the 50 Hz loop drains the queue between control ticks and replies.

Run headless (plain python) or with the interactive viewer (macOS: mjpython):

    duck-sim --rl-repo ../microduck_rl --policies ../microduck/policies
    uv run mjpython -m microduck_mcp.sim_server --viewer ...
