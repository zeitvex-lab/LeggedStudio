# robot_retargeter

English | [中文](README_zh.md)

A toolkit for retargeting human motion (SMPL-X) or source-robot motion to target humanoid robots, with support for side-by-side multi-robot visualization.

## Overview

This project provides a complete motion-retargeting pipeline with three main stages:

1. **Replay / keypoint extraction**: Extract skeletal keypoints from SMPL-X motion (`.npz`) or source-robot motion (`.csv`).
2. **Retargeting**: Map keypoints to a target robot model via inverse kinematics ([mink](https://github.com/kevinzakka/mink) + MuJoCo) and generate robot motion.
3. **Visualization**: Play one or more retargeted target robots side by side.

Directory layout:

| Directory | Contents |

## Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
# Clone with regular Git
git clone https://github.com/ccrpRepo/robot_retargeter.git
cd robot_retargeter
```

### Python environment

Python >= 3.10 is required (developed on Python 3.11). A virtual environment (conda / venv) is recommended.

```bash
# 1) Create and activate an environment (conda as an example)
conda create -n robot_retargeter python=3.11 -y
conda activate robot_retargeter

# 2) Install dependencies
pip install -e .
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### SMPL-X models (downloaded separately)

SMPL-X model files are **not** included in this repository (subject to their own license terms). To use the SMPL-X pipeline (`retarget_from_smplx.sh`), download them manually:

1. Register and download from the official site: [smplx model download](https://download.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php?domain=smplx&sfile=smplx_lockedhead_20230207.zip) (download "SMPL-X" models in `.npz` format).
2. Place files under `asset/smplx/` as follows:

   ```
   asset/smplx/
     SMPLX_NEUTRAL.npz
     SMPLX_MALE.npz
     SMPLX_FEMALE.npz
   ```

### Motion dataset (AMASS)

`dataset/ACCAD/` contains a small set of open-source sample motions from the **ACCAD** subset of AMASS (SMPL-X `.npz`) for quick trial. For more motion data, download from AMASS:

- AMASS website (register to download): https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/

After downloading, extract and place `.npz` files under any directory in `dataset/` (for example `dataset/ACCAD/`), then point `SMPL_MOTION_FILE` to the desired file.

## Usage

The `bash/` directory provides two one-command scripts that run all three stages automatically: keypoint generation -> retargeting -> visualization. By default, scripts use `python` from the currently activated environment. You can also override with `PYTHON_BIN`.

### 1) Retarget from SMPL-X motion

```bash
./bash/retarget_from_smplx.sh
```

You can customize parameters through environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SMPL_MOTION_FILE` | `dataset/ACCAD/Form_1_stageii.npz` | Input SMPL-X motion file |
| `VIS_ROBOTS` | `g1 h2 t800 r1` | Target robot list (space-separated, multiple allowed) |
| `KEYPOINTS_NAME` | Derived from motion file name | Keypoints / output motion name |
| `SOURCE_FPS` | `120` | Source motion frame rate |
| `RENDER_FPS` | `30` | Visualization render frame rate |
| `PYTHON_BIN` | Auto-detected | Python interpreter to use |

Example (custom robots and motion file):

```bash
VIS_ROBOTS="g1 jaka_pi h2 t800" \
SMPL_MOTION_FILE="dataset/ACCAD/Form_1_stageii.npz" \
./bash/retarget_from_smplx.sh
```

### 2) Retarget from source-robot motion

![retarget preview](retarget_from_g1_dance1_subject2_preview.gif)

```bash
./bash/retarget_from_robot.sh
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ROBOT_MOTION_FILE` | `dataset/lafan1_g1/dance1_subject2.csv` | Source robot motion file |
| `ORIGIN_ROBOT` | `g1` | Source robot name (provides skeleton config) |
| `VIS_ROBOTS` | `h2 r1` | Target robot list (space-separated, multiple allowed) |
| `SOURCE_FPS` | `30` | Source motion frame rate |
| `RENDER_FPS` | `30` | Visualization render frame rate |
| `PYTHON_BIN` | Auto-detected | Python interpreter to use |

Example:

```bash
VIS_ROBOTS="jaka_pi h2 t800 pnd_adam" \
ROBOT_MOTION_FILE="dataset/bones_g1/grab_walk_ff_180_001__A550_M.csv" \
ORIGIN_ROBOT="g1" \
SOURCE_FPS=120 \
RENDER_FPS=30 \
./bash/retarget_from_robot.sh
```

After running, retargeted robot motions are saved under `output_data/robot_motion/`.

#### Using the Bones Seed G1 dataset

[Bones Studio](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bones-studio/seed) provides a **Seed** motion dataset recorded on G1. Its raw format (root in Euler angles / centimeters, joints in degrees) differs from the LAFAN1 format required by this project (root in quaternion / meters, joints in radians), so conversion with `scripts/convert_bones_to_lafan1.py` is required first.

**Download data**

```bash
# Download the G1 Seed dataset from Hugging Face
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/bones-studio/seed/blob/main/g1.tar.gz -O g1.tar.gz
tar -xzf g1.tar.gz -C dataset/bones_g1_origin/
```

**Format conversion**

`convert_bones_to_lafan1.py` converts raw G1 CSV files into LAFAN1-compatible format:

| Argument | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--input-root` | `dataset/bones_g1_origin` | Directory of raw CSV files (batch mode) |
| `--output-root` | `dataset/bones_g1` | Output directory for converted CSV files |
| `--input-csv` | None | Convert a single CSV file only |
| `--root-scale` | `0.01` | Root translation scale factor (cm -> m) |

```bash
# Batch-convert all CSV files under dataset/bones_g1_origin/
python scripts/convert_bones_to_lafan1.py

# Convert one file only
python scripts/convert_bones_to_lafan1.py \
    --input-csv dataset/bones_g1_origin/grab_walk_ff_180_001__A550_M.csv

# Custom input / output directories
python scripts/convert_bones_to_lafan1.py \
    --input-root dataset/bones_g1_origin \
    --output-root dataset/bones_g1
```

After conversion, pass generated CSV directly into the retargeting pipeline:

```bash
VIS_ROBOTS="jaka_pi h2 t800 pnd_adam" \
ROBOT_MOTION_FILE="dataset/bones_g1/grab_walk_ff_180_001__A550_M.csv" \
ORIGIN_ROBOT="g1" \
SOURCE_FPS=120 \
RENDER_FPS=30 \
./bash/retarget_from_robot.sh
```

## Core Mechanisms

### 1) Skeleton matching
source: smplx model  --->  agibot_x2 model

![SMPL-X and agibot_x2 skeleton matching](scale_fig.png)

Because source skeleton (SMPL-X) and target robot have different limb lengths, the source keypoints are scaled link by link using per-link length ratios, so dimensions match the target robot while **preserving each link direction**.

Skeleton scaling pseudocode (corresponding to `compute_robot_link_lengths` / `compute_link_geometry_from_positions` / `compute_link_scale_factors` / `apply_link_scales_to_positions` in `scripts/smpl_replay.py`):

```text
# Inputs:
#   robot_mjcf            target robot MJCF model
#   robot_links           link definitions {link_name: (parent_body, child_body)}
#   skeleton_positions    source skeleton keypoint sequence, shape [T, K, 3]
#   skeleton_links        source skeleton link definitions {link_name: (parent_body, child_body)}

# Step 1: compute target-robot link lengths (distance between endpoints in world coordinates at zero pose)
mj_forward(robot_mjcf)                      # forward kinematics for body world positions
for link_name, (parent, child) in robot_links:
    robot_len[link_name] = || xpos[child] - xpos[parent] ||

# Step 2: compute source-skeleton link vectors and lengths (per frame)
for link_name, (parent, child) in skeleton_links:
    link_vec[link_name]     = skeleton_positions[:, child] - skeleton_positions[:, parent]   # [T, 3]
    skeleton_len[link_name] = norm(link_vec[link_name], axis=-1)                             # [T]

# Step 3: compute per-link scale factor (per frame, target length / source length)
for link_name in skeleton_links:
    scale[link_name] = robot_len[link_name] / skeleton_len[link_name]   # [T]

# Step 4: rebuild keypoint positions from parent to child along topology
#         preserve source direction, only scale length
scaled_pos = copy(skeleton_positions)
for link_name, (parent, child) in skeleton_links:    # traverse parent -> child
    scaled_pos[:, child] = scaled_pos[:, parent] + scale[link_name][:, None] * link_vec[link_name]

# Output: scaled_pos -- keypoints matched to target robot dimensions
```

In mathematical form, for link $i$ (parent keypoint $p$, child keypoint $c$) at frame $t$:

$$
s_i^{(t)} = \frac{L_i^{\text{robot}}}{\lVert \mathbf{x}_c^{(t)} - \mathbf{x}_p^{(t)} \rVert}, \qquad
\hat{\mathbf{x}}_c^{(t)} = \hat{\mathbf{x}}_p^{(t)} + s_i^{(t)} \left( \mathbf{x}_c^{(t)} - \mathbf{x}_p^{(t)} \right)
$$

Here, $L_i^{\text{robot}}$ is the fixed robot link length, $\mathbf{x}$ is the original keypoint, and $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ is the scaled keypoint.

> Notes:
> - Scaling is applied segment by segment from parent to child. Child position is parent + (original direction vector x scale factor), so only length changes while direction is preserved.
> - Scale factors are computed **per frame** (`link_scale_is_static = False`), adapting to subtle pose-dependent source-length changes.
> - In addition, root translation is scaled by leg-length ratio (`compute_leg_displacement_scale` / `scale_keypoint_frame_displacements`) to better match stride scale.

#### Root scaling

To keep motion amplitude consistent between source/target bodies (especially when leg-length difference is large), a displacement scale is computed from `target leg length / source leg length`, then applied uniformly to root frame-to-frame displacement in $x,y,z$.

- Leg length definition: thigh length + calf length (averaged over left/right legs).
- Purpose: adjust global stride and displacement scale so motion appears more natural on target robots.

#### Adaptation note (tilted-hip configurations)

In the current skeleton definition, `left_shoulder - neck - right_shoulder` and `left_hip - hips_mean - right_hip` are approximately collinear (horizontal) by default.
For tilted-hip robots such as Unitree t800, it is recommended to add two extra mapping points on left/right hip sides and connect them as fixed offsets to corresponding `hip_roll_link`, to better represent pelvic tilt and left-right hip asymmetry.

![t800 note](hip_spheres.png)

### 2) Knee bending

To improve lower-limb reachability and mechanical behavior, the pipeline performs two-bone (hip-knee-foot) geometric reconstruction for knees.
Bending strength is controlled by `knee_angle_offset_degrees`:

- The document figure uses `60.0` degrees for visualization only.
- Typical practical value is `15.0` degrees.
- In `smpl_replay.py`, this offset is enabled by default.
- In `robot_replay.py`, it takes effect only when `enable_knee_angle_offset_degrees: true` is explicitly set.

The core uses two-bone IK and the law of cosines. Let:

- $a$: thigh length (hip->knee)
- $b$: calf length (knee->foot)
- $d$: target hip-ankle distance (hip->target\_foot)

Then projection length along hip-ankle direction and perpendicular lift are:

$$
x = \frac{a^2 - b^2 + d^2}{2d}, \qquad
h = \sqrt{\max(a^2 - x^2,\, 0)}
$$

Reconstructed knee position is:

$$
\mathbf{p}_{knee} = \mathbf{p}_{hip} + x\,\mathbf{u} + h\,\mathbf{v}
$$

where $\mathbf{u}$ is the unit direction from hip to target ankle, and $\mathbf{v}$ is bend direction in the bend plane.
Important note: in knee-bending step, the hip-to-ankle vector direction (the $\mathbf{u}$ direction) is kept unchanged; only its length (target hip-ankle distance $d$) is adjusted, then knee position is reconstructed accordingly.
Implementation also keeps bend direction consistent with original knee-fold preference to avoid knee inversion.

### 3) Contact detection

Contact detection usually covers both hands and feet; for each foot, two contact probes (front and rear) are used to more robustly identify support and lift-off states.
![foot_contact](foot_contact_fig.png)

Contact state is determined by dual conditions: low speed + low height (see `compute_contact_sequence` / `compute_robot_contact_sequence`):

$$
\text{contact}(t,c)=\big(v_{t,c}\le v_{th}\big)\;\land\;\big(z_{t,c}\le h_{th}\big)
$$

where:

- $v_{t,c}$: windowed speed of contact point $c$ at frame $t$ (computed via `contact_vel_calculate_window`)
- $z_{t,c}$: contact-point height
- $v_{th}$: `contact_vel_threshold`
- $h_{th}$: `contact_height_threshold`

This design suppresses both false positives from low-height fast passing and high-height slow swinging.

### 4) Adaptive height

After contact is detected, the system estimates per-frame ground-height offset and shifts the whole keypoint sequence downward (z only), so support feet remain more stably grounded.

1. At each frame, use the minimum height among currently active contacts as reference height.
2. If no contact is active at that frame, reuse previous frame's height.
3. Apply first-order low-pass filter to height sequence (`contact_height_lpf_alpha`):

$$
y_t = \alpha x_t + (1-\alpha)y_{t-1}, \qquad 0<\alpha\le1
$$

4. Apply z-translation to all keypoints:

$$
z'_{t,k} = z_{t,k} - y_t
$$

Smaller $\alpha$ gives smoother but more delayed ground-following behavior.

### 5) Foot-contact sliding suppression

In `robot_retarget.py`, for contact-active feet (or configured contact bodies), a contact-locked target is introduced:

1. Take mean source-keypoint position over each continuous contact interval as the fixed target of that interval.
2. When contact is true, IK uses that fixed target; when contact is false, target follows the original trajectory.
3. This constraint is added as an extra `FrameTask` in optimization, weighted by `contact_pos_fixed_factor`.

This significantly reduces foot sliding during support phase while preserving motion freedom during swing phase.
