/**
 * @brief Base class for MuJoCo ROS 2 control plugins
 *
 * Plugins extend mujoco_ros2_control with custom behavior, e.g. publishing extra topics or
 * applying external forces.
 *
 * Three optional hooks are available. Override whichever fits your use case:
 *
 * - `update()` runs on the ros2_control control thread, once per `write()` cycle. `data` is a
 *   recent snapshot, not the live `mj_data_`. Use this for anything that doesn't need to run on
 *   exactly one physics step, e.g. publishing sensor data or servicing a trigger.
 * - `pre_step()` runs on the physics thread, immediately before every `mj_step()`, with direct
 *   access to the live `mj_data_`. Use this for anything that must hold for exactly one step,
 *   e.g. a hard kinematic override. There's no command buffer: an untouched entry keeps its
 *   last value, so releasing a command (e.g. an expired force) needs an explicit write. This
 *   should be used with caution!
 * - `on_reset()` runs immediately after a world reset, with the live `mj_data_` in its
 *   post-reset state. Use this to clear plugin state that refers to the pre-reset world,
 *   e.g. a latched command.
 *
 * @note All hooks must avoid blocking or the control loop or simulation itself will be held up!
