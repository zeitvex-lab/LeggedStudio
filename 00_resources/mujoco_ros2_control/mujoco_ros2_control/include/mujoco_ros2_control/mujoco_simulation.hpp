/**
 * @brief ROS 2-based container for the mujoco Simulate application.
 *
 * This class wraps the MuJoCo simulation and Simulate application, while providing necessary
 * hooks to the ros2_control system interface to enable interaction with the sim using
 * "normal" ROS 2 constructs.
 *
 * This class is responsible for mujoco model and data, along with threads for the main physics
 * and rendering loops. It also provides several ROS interfaces for interacting with the
 * underlying simulation - including publishing simulated time to /clock, as well as services
 * for pausing, stepping, and resetting the simulation.
 *
 * Importantly, the physics loop is intended to run at whatever speed (relative realtime) is
 * requested by the user. It is important to not interrupt the loop with locking calls that
 * interact with either the physics sim data, `mj_data_`,  or the model, `mj_model_`.
 * Instead, consumers of this class are provided with functions to read all sim data and provide
 * control inputs from their own mjData containers.
 *
 * The functions relevant to interacting with the physics sim's mjData are:
 *
 * `copy_physics_data(...)` will lock the sim and do a full copy of the existing `mj_data_`
 * into the provided container, which can be used as the caller requires. Because the physics
 * loop can hold the sim mutex for a large fraction of a display refresh while it batches
 * steps, this can block the caller and should not be used from latency-sensitive threads.
 *
 * `acquire_data_snapshot()` instead borrows the most recent completed post-step snapshot of
 * `mj_data_`, produced by the physics loop into a separate buffer. Acquiring is a pointer
 * swap under a mutex that is never held for longer than a swap, so the caller performs no
 * scene-sized copy and never waits on physics stepping or refresh. The returned data may
 * lag `mj_data_` by a few timesteps. This is what the hardware interface uses in `write()`.
 *
 * `apply_control_data(...)` will copy control inputs from the provided mjData into staging
 * buffers that the physics loop applies to `mj_data_` immediately before each step.
 * Specifically, it stages `ctrl` and `qfrc_applied`. Both of these values should come from
 * the interfaces consuming this class. This  This only takes the control staging mutex
 * and never blocks on physics stepping.
 *
 * `overwrite_physics_data(...)` will completely replace the data for the sim. Should be used
 * with extreme caution.
 *
 * `set_pre_step_callback(...)` registers a callback which will be triggered in the Physics
 * Loop. It will be called immediately before `mj_step()`, providing direct access to
 * `mj_data_` immediately before progressing the simulation. This gives consumers direct
 * access to access and modify the data immediately before integration. Users should be
 * extremely careful with this callback, as it exposes "god like" powers to the simulation
 * environment and can break, slow down, or otherwise damage the simulation. This should also
 * be used with caution.
 *
 * Thread safety is still somewhat messy, as callers are provided with a simulation mutex that
 * locks the model and data while the actual mujoco engine moves the sim forward. Callers
 * need to be wary of locking that mutex external to this class, as it can have significant
 * consequences on the simulation's speed.
 *
