    - Different URDF meshes can share a filename stem, so colliding stems get an
      "__N" suffix so each resolves to its own asset directory. For example, if
      running multiple UR types there will be a shoulder/ and shoulder__1/ directory.
    - This happens BEFORE the pregen lookup. So if the asset_dir already
      contains shoulder/ and shoulder__1/ from a prior run, the first source
      will grab shoulder and the second source will grab shoulder__1.
    - stem_to_original_uri tracks which source uri claimed each stem slot, in

    - A subset-equality check on (is_pre_generated, filename, scale, color) dedupes
