# Prints a list of all moveable links in an URDF that are missing inertial data.

# down to having at least one statically attached object to every non-fixed joint's children.
# This is a little helper script to identify joints/links that are missing required data
# because it can be really annoying to identify what is missing when converting URDFs,
# and the errors from MuJoCo's XML loader do not give info.
