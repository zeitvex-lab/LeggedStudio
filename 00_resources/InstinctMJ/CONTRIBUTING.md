# Contributing to InstinctMJ

Thank you for helping improve `InstinctMJ`.

This repository provides humanoid RL tasks on top of `mjlab`, so contributions should prioritize clear validation and minimal, focused changes.

## Before You Start

- For larger features or refactors, open an issue first so scope and compatibility can be discussed before implementation.
- Keep changes local to `InstinctMJ` unless the change clearly requires coordination with `mjlab` or `instinct_rl`.
- Preserve existing task semantics unless the pull request explicitly proposes a behavior change.

## Development Setup

Clone the sibling repositories, sync the environment, then switch the sibling
repositories into local editable installs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab.git
git clone https://github.com/project-instinct/instinct_rl.git
git clone https://github.com/project-instinct/InstinctMJ.git

cd InstinctMJ
uv sync
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python --no-deps -e ../mjlab -e ../instinct_rl
```

If you use `pip`, install `mjlab`, `instinct_rl`, and `InstinctMJ` from the public repositories in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e "git+https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab.git#egg=mjlab"
pip install -e "git+https://github.com/project-instinct/instinct_rl.git#egg=instinct_rl"
pip install -e .
```

## Contribution Guidelines

- Keep pull requests scoped and avoid mixing unrelated refactors with task logic changes.
- Match the existing code style and repository structure.
- Prefer `mjlab`-native implementations over compatibility layers or adapters.
- Preserve task IDs, training workflow, and command-line entry points unless the change intentionally updates public interfaces.
- Update documentation when user-facing behavior, setup, or commands change.

## Validation

At minimum, include the checks you ran in the pull request description. Typical validation includes:

- `python -m py_compile ...` for changed Python modules
- task import / registration checks such as `instinct-list-envs`
- focused train / play / script commands relevant to the changed task family

If a change is not easily testable in the current environment, explain what was verified and what still needs manual validation.
